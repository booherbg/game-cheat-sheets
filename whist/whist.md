# Whist Cheat Sheet

A classic trick-taking partnership card game that predates bridge. Partners work together to take as many tricks as possible. The last card dealt determines trump, or play can be no-trump. Simple rules but deep strategy.

## Setup
- Deck: Full 52-card deck
- Players: 4 (2 teams, partners sit across from each other)
- Scoring: Teams try to take tricks above 6 ("book")
- Trump: Last card dealt (face-up) determines trump suit, or no-trump variant
- No table talk or signaling

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 13 cards each (all cards dealt)
- Last card dealt is turned face-up and determines trump suit
- Dealer's partner holds the trump card until first trick is played
- Partners sit across from each other

### 2. Playing

**First Trick:**
- Player to dealer's left leads (plays any single card)
- Play moves clockwise around the table

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- Winner of previous trick leads
- Players must follow suit if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump
- Trump always beats non-trump
- If multiple trumps are played, highest trump wins
- Otherwise highest card of the led suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

### 3. Scoring

After all 13 tricks are played, teams score points:

**Trick Scoring:**
- Each trick above 6 ("book") = 1 point
- Example: Team takes 8 tricks = 2 points (8 - 6 = 2)
- Example: Team takes 4 tricks = 0 points (below book)

**Game End:**
- First team to reach 7 points wins the game
- Some variants play to 5 or 9 points
- If both teams reach winning score in same hand, team with higher score wins

**No-Trump Variant:**
- In no-trump whist, there is no trump suit
- Players must follow suit, highest card of led suit wins
- Scoring remains the same (tricks above 6)

## Card Rankings

Cards rank from low to high within each suit:
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

**When Trump is Set:**
- Trump suit beats all non-trump suits
- Within trump suit, cards rank normally (2 low, A high)
- If multiple trumps are played, highest trump wins

**No-Trump:**
- All suits are equal
- Must follow suit if possible
- Highest card of led suit wins

## Strategy Tips
- Count cards carefully—know what's been played
- Communicate with your partner through card play (but no table talk)
- Lead your long suits to establish control
- If you have strong trumps, let opponents break them first
- Leading low cards in a suit you're long in can help you control it
- Try to void (get rid of all cards in) a suit early so you can trump
- If your partner leads a high card, they likely have control of that suit
- Watch what your partner discards—it reveals their hand strength
- If you're short in a suit, consider leading it to force opponents to use trump
- Save high trumps for when you need them (don't waste them on low tricks)
- Track which high cards have been played, especially aces and kings
- If you have the lead and want to draw out trumps, lead a suit you're short in
- In no-trump, focus on establishing long suits and forcing opponents to follow
- Leading from your longest suit is often the best opening lead
- If you have ace-king in a suit, lead the king first to see if ace is needed
- Don't lead away from an ace unless you have a good reason
- If your partner leads a low card, they may be trying to establish that suit
