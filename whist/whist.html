<h1>Whist Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A classic trick-taking partnership card game that predates bridge. Partners work together to take as many tricks as possible. The last card dealt determines trump, or play can be no-trump. Simple rules but deep strategy.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: Full 52-card deck</li>
<li>Players: 4 (2 teams, partners sit across from each other)</li>
<li>Scoring: Teams try to take tricks above 6 (&quot;book&quot;)</li>
<li>Trump: Last card dealt (face-up) determines trump suit, or no-trump variant</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 13 cards each (all cards dealt)</li>
<li>Last card dealt is turned face-up and determines trump suit</li>
<li>Dealer&#39;s partner holds the trump card until first trick is played</li>
<li>Partners sit across from each other</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>First Trick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Player to dealer&#39;s left leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner of previous trick leads</li>
<li>Players must follow suit if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump</li>
<li>If multiple trumps are played, highest trump wins</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of the led suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 13 tricks are played, teams score points:</p>
<p><strong>Trick Scoring:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each trick above 6 (&quot;book&quot;) = 1 point</li>
<li>Example: Team takes 8 tricks = 2 points (8 - 6 = 2)</li>
<li>Example: Team takes 4 tricks = 0 points (below book)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First team to reach 7 points wins the game</li>
<li>Some variants play to 5 or 9 points</li>
<li>If both teams reach winning score in same hand, team with higher score wins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No-Trump Variant:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In no-trump whist, there is no trump suit</li>
<li>Players must follow suit, highest card of led suit wins</li>
<li>Scoring remains the same (tricks above 6)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Card Rankings</h2>
<p>Cards rank from low to high within each suit:</p>
<ul>
<li>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When Trump is Set:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trump suit beats all non-trump suits</li>
<li>Within trump suit, cards rank normally (2 low, A high)</li>
<li>If multiple trumps are played, highest trump wins</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No-Trump:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All suits are equal</li>
<li>Must follow suit if possible</li>
<li>Highest card of led suit wins</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Count cards carefully—know what&#39;s been played</li>
<li>Communicate with your partner through card play (but no table talk)</li>
<li>Lead your long suits to establish control</li>
<li>If you have strong trumps, let opponents break them first</li>
<li>Leading low cards in a suit you&#39;re long in can help you control it</li>
<li>Try to void (get rid of all cards in) a suit early so you can trump</li>
<li>If your partner leads a high card, they likely have control of that suit</li>
<li>Watch what your partner discards—it reveals their hand strength</li>
<li>If you&#39;re short in a suit, consider leading it to force opponents to use trump</li>
<li>Save high trumps for when you need them (don&#39;t waste them on low tricks)</li>
<li>Track which high cards have been played, especially aces and kings</li>
<li>If you have the lead and want to draw out trumps, lead a suit you&#39;re short in</li>
<li>In no-trump, focus on establishing long suits and forcing opponents to follow</li>
<li>Leading from your longest suit is often the best opening lead</li>
<li>If you have ace-king in a suit, lead the king first to see if ace is needed</li>
<li>Don&#39;t lead away from an ace unless you have a good reason</li>
<li>If your partner leads a low card, they may be trying to establish that suit</li>
</ul>
