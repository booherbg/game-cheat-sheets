# Hearts Cheat Sheet

A trick-taking card game where the goal is to avoid taking tricks containing hearts or the Queen of Spades. The player with the lowest score wins. Hearts cannot be led until they've been "broken" (a heart has been played on a previous trick).

## Setup
- Deck: Full 52-card deck
- Players: 4 (best with 4, can play 3-6)
- Scoring: Each heart = 1 point, Queen of Spades = 13 points
- Goal: Lowest score wins (game ends when someone reaches 100 points)
- No trump suit

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 13 cards each (all cards dealt)
- Before play begins, players pass 3 cards to another player (direction rotates each hand)

**Passing Rules:**
- Hand 1: Pass left
- Hand 2: Pass right
- Hand 3: Pass across
- Hand 4: No pass ("keep" hand)
- Pattern repeats every 4 hands

### 2. Playing

**First Trick:**
- Player with 2♣ leads (must lead 2♣)

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- Winner of previous trick leads
- Players must follow suit if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card (including hearts or Queen of Spades)
- Highest card of the led suit wins the trick
- Hearts cannot be led until they've been "broken" (unless you have only hearts)

**Breaking Hearts:**
- Hearts are "broken" when a player cannot follow suit and plays a heart
- Once broken, hearts can be led on any subsequent trick
- Exception: If you have only hearts remaining, you may lead hearts even if they haven't been broken

### 3. Scoring

After all 13 tricks are played, players count penalty points:
- Each heart taken: 1 point
- Queen of Spades: 13 points
- **Shooting the Moon**: If one player takes all 26 points (all 13 hearts + Queen of Spades), that player scores 0 and all others score 26

Deal moves to the left (clockwise), play continues until one player reaches 100 points. The player with the lowest score wins.

## Card Rankings

No trump suit. Cards rank from low to high within each suit:
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

The Queen of Spades is just a high spade (not a special suit), but it's worth 13 penalty points if taken.

## Strategy Tips
- Pass high cards (especially A, K, Q) in suits you're short in
- Pass the Queen of Spades if you can (unless shooting the moon)
- Keep low cards in suits you're long in to control when they're led
- Try to void (get rid of all cards in) a suit early, especially spades
- If you have the Queen of Spades, try to get someone else to lead spades so you can discard it
- Watch what others are passing to you—it reveals their strategy
- Leading low cards in a suit you're long in can help you control the suit
- If you're close to 100 points, play more defensively
- Shooting the moon is risky but can save you—only attempt if you have strong cards
- Don't break hearts early unless you have to or it's strategically advantageous
- Keep track of which hearts and the Queen of Spades have been played
- If you're winning a trick and hearts haven't been broken, avoid taking it unless necessary
