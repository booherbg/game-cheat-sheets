<h1>Spades Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A trick-taking partnership card game where spades are always trump. Teams bid on how many tricks they&#39;ll take, and must meet their combined bid to score points. Going over or under the bid results in penalties.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: Full 52-card deck</li>
<li>Players: 4 (2 teams, partners sit across from each other)</li>
<li>Scoring: Teams bid tricks, must meet bid to score</li>
<li>Spades are always trump (no bidding for trump)</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 13 cards each (all cards dealt)</li>
<li>Partners sit across from each other</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding</h3>
<p><strong>Bidding Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting with player to dealer&#39;s left, each player bids how many tricks they will take (0-13)</li>
<li>Partners&#39; bids are combined to form the team bid</li>
<li>Example: Partner A bids 4, Partner B bids 3 → team bid is 7</li>
<li><strong>Nil bid</strong>: A player can bid 0 (&quot;nil&quot;) - they must take zero tricks (worth 100 points if successful, -100 if they take any trick)</li>
<li><strong>Blind nil</strong>: If a team is losing by 100+ points, one partner can bid &quot;blind nil&quot; before seeing their cards (worth 200 points if successful, -200 if they take any trick)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>First Trick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Player to dealer&#39;s left leads (plays any single card, except spades)</li>
<li>Spades cannot be led until they&#39;ve been &quot;broken&quot; (a spade has been played on a trick)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner of previous trick leads</li>
<li>Players must follow suit if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump (spades)</li>
<li>Spades always beat non-spades</li>
<li>If multiple spades are played, highest spade wins</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of the led suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Breaking Spades:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spades are &quot;broken&quot; when a player cannot follow suit and plays a spade</li>
<li>Once broken, spades can be led on any subsequent trick</li>
<li>Exception: If you have only spades remaining, you may lead spades even if they haven&#39;t been broken</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 13 tricks are played, teams score points based on their bid:</p>
<p><strong>If team meets or exceeds their bid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 points per trick bid</li>
<li>1 point per overtrick (trick taken beyond the bid)</li>
<li>Example: Bid 7, take 8 tricks = 70 + 1 = 71 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If team fails to meet their bid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>-10 points per trick bid</li>
<li>Example: Bid 7, take 6 tricks = -70 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nil Bids:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Successful nil: +100 points (team still scores normal tricks)</li>
<li>Failed nil: -100 points (team still scores normal tricks)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Blind Nil:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Successful blind nil: +200 points</li>
<li>Failed blind nil: -200 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First team to reach 500 points wins</li>
<li>If both teams reach 500 in the same hand, team with higher score wins</li>
<li>If tied, play continues until one team has a higher score</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Spades are always trump. Cards rank from low to high within each suit:</p>
<p><strong>Spades (Trump):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2♠, 3♠, 4♠, 5♠, 6♠, 7♠, 8♠, 9♠, 10♠, J♠, Q♠, K♠, A♠</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Suits (Non-Trump):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A</li>
</ul>
<p>Spades always beat non-spades. If multiple spades are played, highest spade wins.</p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Count cards carefully—know what&#39;s been played</li>
<li>Communicate with your partner through card play (but no table talk)</li>
<li>If you have strong spades, let opponents break them first</li>
<li>Leading low cards in a suit you&#39;re long in can help you control it</li>
<li>Try to void (get rid of all cards in) a suit early so you can trump</li>
<li>If your partner leads a high card, they likely have control of that suit</li>
<li>Don&#39;t overbid—it&#39;s better to bid conservatively than to go set</li>
<li>Watch what your partner discards—it reveals their hand strength</li>
<li>If you&#39;re short in a suit, consider leading it to force opponents to use trump</li>
<li>Save high spades for when you need them (don&#39;t waste them on low tricks)</li>
<li>If bidding nil, pass high cards and dangerous suits to your partner</li>
<li>When defending against nil, try to force the nil bidder to take a trick</li>
<li>Track which cards have been played, especially high cards and spades</li>
<li>If you have the lead and spades haven&#39;t been broken, lead a suit you&#39;re short in to force someone to break spades</li>
</ul>
