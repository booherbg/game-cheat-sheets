# Spades Cheat Sheet

A trick-taking partnership card game where spades are always trump. Teams bid on how many tricks they'll take, and must meet their combined bid to score points. Going over or under the bid results in penalties.

## Setup
- Deck: Full 52-card deck
- Players: 4 (2 teams, partners sit across from each other)
- Scoring: Teams bid tricks, must meet bid to score
- Spades are always trump (no bidding for trump)
- No table talk or signaling

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 13 cards each (all cards dealt)
- Partners sit across from each other

### 2. Bidding

**Bidding Process:**
- Starting with player to dealer's left, each player bids how many tricks they will take (0-13)
- Partners' bids are combined to form the team bid
- Example: Partner A bids 4, Partner B bids 3 → team bid is 7
- **Nil bid**: A player can bid 0 ("nil") - they must take zero tricks (worth 100 points if successful, -100 if they take any trick)
- **Blind nil**: If a team is losing by 100+ points, one partner can bid "blind nil" before seeing their cards (worth 200 points if successful, -200 if they take any trick)

### 3. Playing

**First Trick:**
- Player to dealer's left leads (plays any single card, except spades)
- Spades cannot be led until they've been "broken" (a spade has been played on a trick)

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- Winner of previous trick leads
- Players must follow suit if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump (spades)
- Spades always beat non-spades
- If multiple spades are played, highest spade wins
- Otherwise highest card of the led suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

**Breaking Spades:**
- Spades are "broken" when a player cannot follow suit and plays a spade
- Once broken, spades can be led on any subsequent trick
- Exception: If you have only spades remaining, you may lead spades even if they haven't been broken

### 4. Scoring

After all 13 tricks are played, teams score points based on their bid:

**If team meets or exceeds their bid:**
- 10 points per trick bid
- 1 point per overtrick (trick taken beyond the bid)
- Example: Bid 7, take 8 tricks = 70 + 1 = 71 points

**If team fails to meet their bid:**
- -10 points per trick bid
- Example: Bid 7, take 6 tricks = -70 points

**Nil Bids:**
- Successful nil: +100 points (team still scores normal tricks)
- Failed nil: -100 points (team still scores normal tricks)

**Blind Nil:**
- Successful blind nil: +200 points
- Failed blind nil: -200 points

**Game End:**
- First team to reach 500 points wins
- If both teams reach 500 in the same hand, team with higher score wins
- If tied, play continues until one team has a higher score

## Trump Order (Low → High)

Spades are always trump. Cards rank from low to high within each suit:

**Spades (Trump):**
- 2♠, 3♠, 4♠, 5♠, 6♠, 7♠, 8♠, 9♠, 10♠, J♠, Q♠, K♠, A♠

**Other Suits (Non-Trump):**
- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A

Spades always beat non-spades. If multiple spades are played, highest spade wins.

## Strategy Tips
- Count cards carefully—know what's been played
- Communicate with your partner through card play (but no table talk)
- If you have strong spades, let opponents break them first
- Leading low cards in a suit you're long in can help you control it
- Try to void (get rid of all cards in) a suit early so you can trump
- If your partner leads a high card, they likely have control of that suit
- Don't overbid—it's better to bid conservatively than to go set
- Watch what your partner discards—it reveals their hand strength
- If you're short in a suit, consider leading it to force opponents to use trump
- Save high spades for when you need them (don't waste them on low tricks)
- If bidding nil, pass high cards and dangerous suits to your partner
- When defending against nil, try to force the nil bidder to take a trick
- Track which cards have been played, especially high cards and spades
- If you have the lead and spades haven't been broken, lead a suit you're short in to force someone to break spades
