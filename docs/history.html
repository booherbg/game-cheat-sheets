<h1>A Short History of Trick-Taking (and Why Euchre Won the Midwest)</h1>
<p>Trick-taking is one of the great ideas in card games: you lead, everyone else follows if they can, and the best card (or the right trump) takes the pile. No one knows who invented it. We do know it was in Europe by the early 1400s - games like Karnöffel in Germany (attested by the 1420s) used uneven card powers before anyone had settled on a single trump suit.<a href="#source-1">[1]</a> Then, around 1440 in Italy, someone added a permanent fifth suit of picture cards that always beat the other four. We call those cards tarots. The tarot deck was a trick-taking pack first; the fortune-telling came later.<a href="#source-2">[2]</a> From there the idea spread: a fixed trump, follow suit, win the trick. It stuck.</p>
<p>By the 1700s, the English had turned the idea into <strong>Whist</strong> - four players, two teams, no bidding, just play. Quiet, serious, and so popular that Edmond Hoyle wrote <em>A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist</em> in 1742 and the book stayed in print for a century.<a href="#source-3">[3]</a><a href="#source-4">[4]</a> Whist was the game of gentlemen and coffeehouses; it had rules, literature, and a reputation. It also had a flaw, at least in the eyes of players who wanted more say in the action: the trump suit was decided by a single turned card. No choice. So in the 1890s a variant caught fire - Biritch (Russian Whist), where the dealer could name trump or no trump, and one hand was laid face-up as the &quot;dummy.&quot; That game became Bridge; contract bridge (1925) replaced Whist almost everywhere in polite play within a few decades.<a href="#source-5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the origins of another card game were developing as the immigration story of the German-American played out in the early Midwest.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Jucker becomes Euchre</h2>
<p>In the Alsace and the Palatinate - the strip of land that has spent centuries between France and Germany - people were playing a game called <strong>Juckerspiel</strong>. &quot;Jucker&quot; was the name; the game gave the Jack a starring role. The Jack (in German, <em>Bauer</em> - farmer) outranked the Ace in the trump suit. There was a word for taking all five tricks: <em>Marsch</em>. The earliest clear mention we have is 1792, in a German dictionary, calling it a Palatinate game. By the early 1800s it was in the Rhineland, in stories, in the air.<a href="#source-6">[6]</a><a href="#source-7">[7]</a> And when German-speaking immigrants left for America, the game came with them. Card game historian David Parlett argues that &quot;on linguistic grounds alone there can be no doubt as to Euchre&#39;s origin in the Alsatian game of Juckerspiel as brought to America by German immigrants.&quot;<a href="#source-6">[6]</a></p>
<p>However, in the New World it didn&#39;t stay as &quot;Juckerspiel&quot;. English-speaking players heard &quot;Jucker&quot; and wrote it down as <strong>Euchre</strong> (early spellings included &quot;Eucre&quot; and &quot;Uker&quot;).<a href="#source-6">[6]</a><a href="#source-8">[8]</a> The Jack stayed on top in trump and kept a trace of the old name: we still call it the <strong>right bower</strong>, and the other Jack of the same color the <strong>left bower</strong> - &quot;bower&quot; from <em>Bauer</em>. The word for a clean sweep stayed too: we still say <strong>march</strong> (from <em>Marsch</em>).<a href="#source-6">[6]</a><a href="#source-8">[8]</a> The game didn’t need a rulebook to cross the ocean. It had people.</p>
<p>By 1810, &quot;Eucre&quot; was already turning up in American gaming houses next to Whist. By 1829 it was on <strong>Midwest steamboats</strong> - the riverboats that moved goods and people up and down the Ohio and the Mississippi.<a href="#source-8">[8]</a> Deckhands, travelers, and settlers had hours to kill. Euchre was fast, portable, and easy to teach. It spread up the rivers and into the new states. In 1844 the first written American rules appeared.<a href="#source-8">[8]</a> A few years later, Euchre packs began to include an extra card that could stand in for any trump when you needed it. That card was the <strong>Joker</strong> - and Euchre is the reason it exists in the standard deck at all; jokers first appeared in Euchre packs in the 1850s.<a href="#source-8">[8]</a></p>
<p>For a while, Euchre was often called the <strong>national card game</strong> of the United States. It wasn’t the only one, but it was the one that had caught the country’s attention.<a href="#source-8">[8]</a> Then the country changed. Bridge took over in clubs and parlors. Poker and Rummy took over in others. Euchre didn’t die. It dug in where it had already put down roots: the <strong>Midwest</strong>.<a href="#source-9">[9]</a></p>
<h3>A note on dialect - &#39;Bower&#39; vs &#39;Bar&#39;</h3>
<p>One more trace of the journey shows up in how the word is <em>said</em>, even as of this writing today in 2026. In most of the Euchre Belt, &quot;bower&quot; is pronounced like &quot;flower&quot; (two syllables). But in <strong>Ohio</strong> - especially western Ohio - many players say <strong>&quot;bar&quot;</strong> instead: right bar, left bar.<a href="#source-13">[13]</a><a href="#source-14">[14]</a> Rulebooks and websites usually spell it &quot;bower&quot;; Ohio-focused sources list &quot;Bower (AKA Bar)&quot; and note that &quot;bar&quot; is a common dialect pronunciation there.<a href="#source-13">[13]</a> The likely reason is immigration and oral tradition, not print. <em>Bauer</em> in German is two syllables; in Palatine or local dialects it may have been shortened or flattened in speech. When the game was passed on by word of mouth in German-heavy Ohio, the word may have been heard and repeated as a single syllable - &quot;bar&quot; - and that pronunciation stuck in the same communities where the game itself had put down roots. So you get two reflexes of the same German word: &quot;bower&quot; in the books, &quot;bar&quot; at the table where the rules were passed on via oral tradition in a local dialect.<a href="#source-15">[15]</a></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Euchre Belt</h2>
<p>If you draw a band across the northern United States - Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan - you get what players and writers sometimes call the <strong>Euchre Belt</strong>. The game is still the default there. Family reunions, bars, dorm rooms, and kitchen tables: someone’s always dealing. <strong>Michigan</strong> gets called the buckle of that belt.<a href="#source-9">[9]</a><a href="#source-10">[10]</a> Ask why and you get the same answer again and again: <em>Because we grew up with it.</em> Parents and grandparents taught it. It’s the game you play when the aunts and uncles are in town. That’s not a small thing. Culture doesn’t need a reason to persist beyond &quot;we’ve always done it.&quot; Euchre had a head start in those states. The people who’d brought it had settled there. The game became part of the local grammar - something you assume everyone knows. The exact reason for euchre’s lasting popularity in Michigan is still debated, but family tradition and intergenerational teaching are the usual explanation.<a href="#source-10">[10]</a></p>
<p><strong>Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan</strong> all drew heavy German settlement in the 19th century. So did parts of Illinois and Pennsylvania. The map of &quot;where Germans went&quot; and &quot;where Euchre is still the game&quot; overlap. It’s not a perfect overlap - nothing in cultural history is - but it’s there.<a href="#source-9">[9]</a> Immigration didn’t just bring new workers or new last names. It brought games. Games are lightweight. You don’t need much to play. You need a deck, a table, and someone who remembers the rules. So the games that arrived with the first generations stuck where those generations put down roots. In the Midwest, one of those games was Euchre. In other pockets you got <strong>Pinochle</strong> (also German in origin - from Bezique and regional games like Binokel, carried over by immigrants in the late 1800s; the name comes from Binokel/Binocle).<a href="#source-11">[11]</a> Pinochle added meld: you score for marriages, runs, and &quot;around&quot; combos before a single trick is played. Different flavor, same family. Same story of a game crossing the ocean in someone’s memory.</p>
<p><em>As an aside:</em> Not all German-heritage settlement fed the Euchre Belt. <strong>Germans from Russia</strong> (Volga and Black Sea Germans) left Russia when their privileges were revoked (1870s onward) and settled in the <strong>Northern Plains</strong>—North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and nearby - a different migration path and era than the Ohio/Mississippi corridor.<a href="#source-16">[16]</a><a href="#source-17">[17]</a> In that region, the default card games often weren&#39;t Euchre. <strong>Minnesota Whist</strong> (a variant) was brought to the Upper Midwest by Norwegian immigrants;<a href="#source-18">[18]</a> <strong>Cribbage</strong>, of English origin, also took hold there.<a href="#source-19">[19]</a> So the same broad &quot;German&quot; label hides different streams: Palatine and Alsatian river-corridor settlers birthed Euchre; Germans from Russia and Scandinavian neighbors in the Plains built a card culture around Whist and Cribbage instead.</p>
<p><strong>Why Cribbage runs deep in Minnesota.</strong> Cribbage was invented in England (Sir John Suckling, 1630s) and crossed the Atlantic with English settlers; it was especially popular in New England and was quickly taken up by sailors and fishermen - a two-player game that needed only a deck and a board.<a href="#source-19">[19]</a><a href="#source-20">[20]</a> In Canada and the Great Lakes, cribbage was a game of explorers, whalers, and the fur-trade era; the Hudson&#39;s Bay orbit and trade with Indigenous peoples left a trail of cribbage boards and play.<a href="#source-21">[21]</a> Railway and work camps did the rest. Cribbage boards from the 1880s survive from Canadian Pacific Railway construction crews in what is now Northwestern Ontario;<a href="#source-22">[22]</a> the same kind of portable, two-player pastime suited lumber camps and winter bunkhouses in Minnesota and along the border. Wisconsin had cribbage in print in Milwaukee by 1841 (reprinted from fiction dated 1829), and today Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota still show the strongest concentration of cribbage play in the Midwest.<a href="#source-23">[23]</a> Minnesota&#39;s immigration included <strong>Irish</strong> who had worked as lumberjacks in Canada before moving south - one vector for British Isles and Canadian card-game culture into the Upper Midwest.<a href="#source-24">[24]</a> So cribbage&#39;s depth in Minnesota ties to its English origin, spread by sailors and work camps, and the same Anglo-Canadian and Irish migration streams that helped populate the region.</p>
<p>Hearts and Spades belong to the same big family - trick-taking, follow suit, win or avoid tricks - but they have different lineages. <strong>Hearts</strong> came from European penalty games (Reversis and the like), then took shape in America in the 1880s; the <em>Standard Hoyle</em> of 1887 said it had been played in America for about five years. The Queen of Spades as the big penalty (&quot;Black Lady&quot;) and &quot;shooting the moon&quot; came in later (e.g. 1909 for Black Lady).<a href="#source-12">[12]</a> <strong>Bridge</strong> is Whist’s direct heir: same structure, plus bidding and the dummy.<a href="#source-5">[5]</a></p>
<p><strong>Spades</strong> is a 20th-century American addition to that family. It belongs to the same Whist-derived line: partnership play, bidding, and a trump suit - in this case spades always trump. Bridge author George Coffin placed its introduction in <strong>Cincinnati, Ohio, between 1937 and 1939</strong>; from there it spread through the Midwest and then exploded during <strong>World War II</strong> on military bases - fast, interruptible, ideal for barracks and deployment - and after the war on college campuses. It is now one of the most played partnership card games in the United States.<a href="#source-25">[25]</a> The immigration and migration story is built in. <strong>Bid Whist</strong>, a close relative (also Whist plus bidding), has deep roots in <strong>African American</strong> culture. <em>Black Enterprise</em> (1999), citing research by Angel Beck (author of <em>How to Play Bid Whist</em> and the only syndicated bid whist columnist at the time), reports that the game has been a tradition since <strong>slavery (pre–Civil War)</strong>: enslaved people developed their own adaptation of the card games they saw white people playing, primarily bridge and whist.<a href="#source-29">[29]</a> That origin is also documented in oral tradition and in <em>Rise and Fly</em> (Morrison &amp; Lamb, 2005) and NPR’s coverage; white society sometimes dismissed it as &quot;Black bridge.&quot; <strong>Pullman porters</strong> carried Bid Whist along the rails and into cities during the early 20th century; Black G.I.s played Spades and Bid Whist in the military and brought both games home.<a href="#source-26">[26]</a><a href="#source-27">[27]</a><a href="#source-28">[28]</a> So the same trick-taking idea - lead, follow, trump - shows up again in Spades and Bid Whist, this time tied to 20th-century America: the military, the Great Migration, and Black American community and kinship.</p>
<p>So, all of this to say that the history of modern trick-taking games gives us a kind of family tree. Tarot and the old European games sit at the root; <strong>Whist</strong> and <strong>Juckerspiel</strong> are two main branches. From Whist come <strong>Bridge</strong> (bidding and the dummy) and, in 20th-century America, <strong>Spades</strong>; from the same Whist–Bridge line, <strong>Bid Whist</strong> grew out of Black American tradition since slavery. From Juckerspiel come <strong>Euchre</strong> and the <strong>Joker</strong>. <strong>Hearts</strong> is an American offshoot of European penalty games (avoid the wrong tricks). <strong>Pinochle</strong> belongs to a different branch—Bezique and German meld games—where you score for melds first and tricks second. Same idea of following suit and taking tricks, different ancestry.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>Trick-taking is old. The idea has outlasted empires. What’s newer is how it got <em>local</em>. The same basic idea - lead, follow, trump, take the trick - shows up in dozens of games. Which one you play often depends on where you grew up and who taught you. In the Euchre Belt, that game is Euchre. The bowers and the march and the Joker are the dialect. In other places it’s Pinochle, or Spades, or Bridge, or something else. The games traveled with people. They still do. So the history of trick-taking isn’t just a list of rules. It’s a map of who went where, what they brought, and what they kept playing when they got there.</p>
