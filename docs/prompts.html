<h1>Prompts &amp; Responses</h1>
<p>Documentation of the prompts used to build the game-cheat-sheets project and a concise summary of each response. Before starting I had already created a baseline <a href="../euchre/euchre.md"><code>euchre.md</code></a> cheat sheet for a game night and wanted to automate creating of a printable HTML file (with formatting), serving out cheat sheets via a simple web interface, and extrapolating to other games using an LLM and <code>euchre.md</code> as a base template. Eventually I fell down the rabbit hole of researching how these games relate and realized it was a good opportunity to use agentic AI to run down citable research, resulting in <a href="history.md"><code>docs/history.md</code></a> being written.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Markdown → HTML via npm</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s the best way to port markdown to html via npm?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Compared three options: <strong>marked</strong> (simple, fast, good default), <strong>markdown-it</strong> (plugin-friendly), and <strong>remark</strong> (unified/doc-pipeline). Recommended <code>marked</code> for straightforward conversion and noted it supports GFM. Gave minimal <code>npm install</code> + <code>marked.parse()</code> examples for each.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2. <code>npm run build:euchre</code> to port <code>euchre.md</code> → <code>euchre.html</code></h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to simply be able to run something like <code>npm build:euchre</code> which ports euchre/euchre.md into euchre/euchre.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added <code>package.json</code> with a <code>build:euchre</code> script and <code>marked</code> as a dev dependency. Implemented <code>scripts/build-euchre.js</code> to read <code>euchre/euchre.md</code>, convert with <code>marked</code>, wrap the result in a minimal HTML document (charset, viewport, basic CSS), and write <code>euchre/euchre.html</code>. Raw HTML in the Markdown (e.g. page-break divs) is preserved. Documented <code>npm install</code> and <code>npm run build:euchre</code> in the README.</p>
<hr>
<h2>3. Generic build script and title from Markdown</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want the build script to be generic. Just use the title in the euchre.md for the html title doc. We&#39;ll have more cheat sheets here eventually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Replaced the euchre-specific script with <code>scripts/build.js</code>, which takes a sheet name as an argument (e.g. <code>node scripts/build.js euchre</code>). It reads <code>{name}/{name}.md</code> and writes <code>{name}/{name}.html</code>. The HTML <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> is taken from the first <code>#</code> heading in the Markdown (fallback: sheet name), with proper escaping. Updated <code>package.json</code> to <code>build:euchre</code> → <code>node scripts/build.js euchre</code>. Removed <code>build-euchre.js</code>. Described how to add future sheets (e.g. cribbage) with a matching folder and optional <code>build:cribbage</code> script.</p>
<hr>
<h2>4. <code>.gitignore</code> best practices</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update .gitignore with best practices</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Expanded <code>.gitignore</code> with: <code>node_modules/</code>; npm logs and <code>.npm</code>; Yarn 2+–style paths (for later use); <code>.env</code>, <code>.env.local</code>, <code>.env.*.local</code>; <code>.DS_Store</code>, <code>Thumbs.db</code>; <code>*.log</code>; <code>.idea/</code>, <code>.vscode/</code>, Vim swap files; and <code>coverage/</code>, <code>.nyc_output/</code> for future tests.</p>
<hr>
<h2>5. README: use and adding a new game</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fill out very simple README.md with instructions for use and how to add a new card game</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Wrote a short README with a <strong>Use</strong> section (<code>npm install</code>, <code>npm run build:euchre</code>, and where the HTML goes) and an <strong>Add a new card game</strong> section: create <code>{name}/{name}.md</code>, start with <code>#</code> title, optionally add <code>build:cribbage</code> in <code>package.json</code>, then run the build. Used cribbage as the example.</p>
<hr>
<h2>6. <code>build:all</code>, folder-based build, multiple <code>.md</code> per folder</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add instruction for <code>build:all</code> and include euchre, update README. Also update script so it knows to use the name for the folder, but will port each .md file into its own .html file regardless of name once the folder is found</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Reworked <code>scripts/build.js</code> to be folder-based: you pass a folder name (e.g. <code>euchre</code>); it finds every <code>*.md</code> in that folder and emits a matching <code>*.html</code> (e.g. <code>rules.md</code> → <code>rules.html</code>). With no argument, it discovers all top-level folders (except <code>node_modules</code>, <code>scripts</code>, <code>.git</code>) that contain <code>.md</code> and builds each. Added <code>build:all</code> to <code>package.json</code> (runs <code>node scripts/build.js</code>). Updated the README to document <code>build:euchre</code> and <code>build:all</code>, and to explain that a game folder can hold multiple <code>.md</code> files (names need not match the folder) and that optional <code>build:foo</code> scripts can target a single game.</p>
<hr>
<h2>7. Document this conversation</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. As the final act, let&#39;s document this conversation. Take every prompt that I had and keep it verbatim (including this one), along with a summary of the LLM response that is clear and topical. Create docs/prompts.md with smart formatting so we can document this work we did together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added <code>docs/prompts.md</code> with each user prompt quoted verbatim and a short, topical summary of the corresponding response. Used numbered sections, blockquotes for prompts, and horizontal rules between exchanges so the log is easy to scan and reuse.</p>
<hr>
<h2>8. Serve cheat sheets for review</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally - create a way to serve out these cheat sheets for easy review. Should present an index page with each html file available as a link, with each sub-folder availble as an h2 with links to the files below it. <code>npm serve</code> should run this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added <code>scripts/serve.js</code>, a small Node HTTP server (no extra deps) that serves on port 3000 (or <code>PORT</code>). The index at <code>/</code> is generated: it discovers all top-level folders that contain <code>.html</code> (same skip list as build), renders each folder as an <strong>h2</strong>, and lists links to every <code>.html</code> in that folder below it. Routes like <code>/{folder}/{file}.html</code> serve only those HTML files from allowlisted folders; path traversal is blocked. Added a <code>serve</code> script to <code>package.json</code> (<code>npm run serve</code>). Updated the README with serve instructions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>9. Security audit of serve.js</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a follow-up, please model a cybersecurity researcher who is sensitive to exploiting web servers to gain unauthorized access. Audit build/serve.js to make sure we&#39;re not accidentally opening us up to common attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Wrote <code>docs/SECURITY-AUDIT-serve.md</code> auditing path traversal, symlink escape, XSS, bind exposure, null bytes, HTTP method, info disclosure, and related issues. Hardened <code>scripts/serve.js</code>: <code>escapeHtml</code> now escapes <code>&#39;</code>; listen on <code>HOST</code> (default <code>127.0.0.1</code>) instead of all interfaces; reject <code>filename</code> containing <code>\0</code>; return 405 with <code>Allow: GET</code> for non-GET. Verified path traversal and method handling with curl. Existing allowlist + <code>startsWith</code> checks already mitigated traversal and symlink escape.</p>
<hr>
<h2>10. Generate static index.html and simplify serve</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s create a script that generates an index.html similar to what is served out by node.js - and every time <code>npm run build:all</code> is called, the script re-generates the index.html - this lets us replace the nodejs server entirely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>scripts/generate-index.js</code> that extracts the index generation logic from <code>serve.js</code>. It discovers all folders containing <code>.html</code> files, generates the same HTML structure as the server&#39;s dynamic index, and writes it to <code>index.html</code> at the project root. Updated <code>scripts/build.js</code> to call this script after building all folders when <code>npm run build:all</code> is invoked (no folder argument). This enables static hosting without the Node.js server.</p>
<hr>
<h2>11. Simplify serve to static file server</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. Update <code>npm run serve</code> to just serve out index.html, and update prompts.md with this conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Simplified <code>scripts/serve.js</code> to a basic static file server that serves files from the project root. Removed dynamic index generation and folder discovery logic (now handled by <code>generate-index.js</code>). The server now serves <code>index.html</code> at <code>/</code> and serves other files (like <code>/{folder}/{file}.html</code>) with proper content-type detection and path traversal protection. Updated <code>docs/prompts.md</code> with entries documenting both the index generation feature and the serve simplification.</p>
<hr>
<h2>12. Generate Hearts cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make an equivalent cheat sheet for the game of hearts, using @euchre/euchre.md as the gold standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>hearts/hearts.md</code> following the same format and structure as <code>euchre/euchre.md</code>. Included Setup, Game Flow (Deal, Passing, Playing, Scoring), Card Rankings, and Strategy Tips sections. Added <code>build:hearts</code> script to <code>package.json</code>. The cheat sheet covers Hearts-specific rules like passing cards, breaking hearts, shooting the moon, and the Queen of Spades penalty.</p>
<hr>
<h2>13. Generate Spades cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awesome. Now do the same with spades please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>spades/spades.md</code> using the same template format. Documented Spades as a partnership trick-taking game where spades are always trump, including bidding mechanics, nil and blind nil bids, breaking spades rules, and scoring. Added <code>build:spades</code> script to <code>package.json</code>. The cheat sheet explains how teams bid tricks, must meet their combined bid, and the penalty/reward structure for overtricks and undertricks.</p>
<hr>
<h2>14. Generate Bid Euchre cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. Add bid-euchre.md to euchre/ folder</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>euchre/bid-euchre.md</code> as a variant of euchre for individual play. Documented how players bid on tricks they&#39;ll take (0-5), the highest bidder chooses trump, and scoring where bidders must meet their bid to score points while non-bidders score for tricks taken. Used the same trump order and bower rules as regular euchre. The file is built automatically with <code>build:euchre</code> since it&#39;s in the euchre folder.</p>
<hr>
<h2>15. Generate Call-Ace Euchre cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do one for call-ace euchre</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>euchre/call-ace-euchre.md</code> documenting the 5-player variant where the caller names a specific card (usually an ace) and whoever holds that card becomes their secret partner. The partner&#39;s identity remains hidden until they play the called card. Included strategy tips for callers, secret partners, and defenders. Uses the same trump and bower rules as regular euchre but with adjusted scoring for 5 players.</p>
<hr>
<h2>16. Generate Whist cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. Next, do one for wist</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>whist/whist.md</code> following the same format. Documented Whist as a classic partnership trick-taking game where the last card dealt determines trump (or no-trump variant). Included Setup, Game Flow, Card Rankings, and Strategy Tips. Added <code>build:whist</code> script to <code>package.json</code>. The cheat sheet explains how teams score points for tricks above 6 (&quot;book&quot;) and play continues until one team reaches 7 points.</p>
<hr>
<h2>17. Update Call-Ace Euchre to new ruleset</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update the call-ace euchre to use this ruleset:
Call-Ace Euchre … [4–6 players, &quot;I call upon the ace of (suit)&quot;, maker&#39;s partner or alone; scoring: alone march = number of players, alone 3–4 tricks = 1; partnership march = 2 each (3–4 players) or 3 each (5–6); partnership 3–4 tricks = 1 each; euchred = 2 to each other player.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Rewrote <code>euchre/call-ace-euchre.md</code> to match the given rules. Set player count to 4–6, required the maker to say &quot;I call upon the ace of (suit)&quot; (ace-only), and rewrote scoring for maker alone, partnership, and euchred cases. Adjusted deal, bidding, and strategy for maker/partner/other players. Rebuilt HTML via the euchre build.</p>
<hr>
<h2>18. Add Two-Handed Euchre variant</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a variant for 2-handed euchre from here:
<a href="https://euchre.com/blog/two-handed-euchre/">https://euchre.com/blog/two-handed-euchre/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>euchre/two-handed-euchre.md</code> (and generated HTML) from the Euchre.com two-handed rules. Documented 24-card deck, 2 players, deal (4 hand + 4 face-down + 4 face-up each), trick bidding (minimum 7, Spades-style), only maker scores, 12 tricks per round, and scoring 1–6 for 7–12 tricks; game to 10. Included trump order and strategy. Added the &quot;other variation&quot; (5+3 cards, choose best 5 from 8). Full build regenerated the index.</p>
<hr>
<h2>19. Add Euchre Solitaire variant</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. Write one for euchre solitaire
<a href="https://www.pagat.com/invented/euchre_solitaire.html">https://www.pagat.com/invented/euchre_solitaire.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>euchre/euchre-solitaire.md</code> from the Pagat.com Euchre Solitaire rules. Documented solo play versus the deck: 5 cards + 1 turn card, order up or name trump, you lead first; when you lead the deck burns from the top until it can follow suit or trump; when the deck leads you must follow suit. Scoring as classic two-handed (3–4 = 1, march = 2, euchred = 2 for deck; alone = 4 or −4). Included trump order, running out of cards, and strategy. Built HTML and updated index.</p>
<hr>
<h2>20. Add Joker/Benny rule to euchre</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a rule to euchre that shows how to use a Joker (&quot;Benny&quot; or &quot;British Euchre&quot;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added an optional section to <code>euchre/euchre.md</code> titled &quot;Optional: Joker / Benny (&#39;British Euchre&#39;)&quot;. Described a 25-card deck (24 + Joker or 2♠), Benny as highest trump above the right bower, and three house rules when the Benny is the turn card: dealer chooses trump, trump is Spades, or blind bid. User later removed this section and requested a separate British Euchre file.</p>
<hr>
<h2>21. British Euchre as separate file</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great. Actually take out the part on benny and create a new british-euchre.md file based on the rules</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Removed the Benny/Joker section from <code>euchre/euchre.md</code>. Created <code>euchre/british-euchre.md</code> as a full standalone cheat sheet for British Euchre: 25-card deck, Benny as highest trump, deal and bidding (including when the Benny is the turn card), play, scoring same as standard euchre, optional game to 11, trump-order table with Benny, and &quot;when Benny is turned face-up&quot; options (dealer chooses, spades, blind bid). Built <code>british-euchre.html</code> and regenerated the index. (The file was added in a follow-up after the user noted it had not been created.)</p>
<hr>
<h2>22. Add back-to-index link on all generated pages</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a link back to the index on all pages generated</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Updated <code>scripts/build.js</code> so every built page gets a nav line at the top: <code>&lt;p class=&quot;nav&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;…/index.html&quot;&gt;← Cheat Sheets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>. The href uses one or more <code>../</code> based on folder depth (<code>folder.split(path.sep).map(() =&gt; &#39;..&#39;).join(&#39;/&#39;)</code>) so it resolves correctly from any <code>{folder}/{base}.html</code>. Added <code>.nav</code> and <code>.nav a</code> styles. Rebuilt all pages; the index itself is produced by <code>generate-index.js</code> and is unchanged.</p>
<hr>
<h2>23. Use relative paths for index links (GitHub Pages)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Github projects are hosted on a domain - index works great but when I click through I get a 404 not found.
Links probably need to use relative paths intead of absolute (<code>./euchre</code> instead of <code>/euchre</code>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Changed <code>scripts/generate-index.js</code> so index links use relative paths instead of absolute. Replaced <code>/${folder}/${f}</code> with <code>${folder}/${f}</code> so hrefs are e.g. <code>euchre/euchre.html</code> rather than <code>/euchre/euchre.html</code>. On GitHub Pages (or any host where the site is served from a subpath like <code>username.github.io/repo-name/</code>), absolute paths resolve to the domain root and 404; relative paths resolve correctly. The back-to-index links in built pages already use <code>../index.html</code> from <code>build.js</code> and work as-is. Regenerated <code>index.html</code> via the build.</p>
<hr>
<h2>24. Patience folder: Klondike, Spider, move Euchre Solitaire</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a folder for &#39;patience games&#39;, include standard solitaire (with notes for variants), spider solitaire (from here: <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/spider-solitaire">https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/spider-solitaire</a> ), and move solitaire euchre to the folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>patience/</code> with <code>solitaire.md</code> (standard Klondike: tableau, foundations, stock/waste, draw three, redeals; variant notes for draw one, no redeal, empty tableau, Forty Thieves). Added <code>spider-solitaire.md</code> from Bicycle Cards (two decks, 10 columns, build down, same-suit sequences removed, deal from stock only when no empty columns). Copied <code>euchre-solitaire.md</code> into <code>patience/</code> and deleted it from <code>euchre/</code>. Built all; index gained a patience section.</p>
<hr>
<h2>25. Klondike naming and file rename</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>oh yeah solitaire is actually klondike right? please update accordingly
… Rename the files too</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Updated <code>patience/solitaire.md</code> title and intro to &quot;Klondike Solitaire&quot; and that Klondike is the classic &quot;solitaire&quot; game. Then created <code>patience/klondike.md</code> (same content), removed <code>patience/solitaire.md</code> and <code>patience/solitaire.html</code>, and rebuilt so the index links to <code>klondike</code> instead of <code>solitaire</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>26. Spider Solitaire: final deal and winnability</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Final deal paragraph] is confusing, what does it mean? … how can there be 10 cards left but only 4 to deal
… Is that correct? Is it even possible to win?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Clarified the stock/deal text: standard rule is <strong>5 deals of 10 cards</strong> each, so all 50 cards enter play and the game is winnable. Documented the Bicycle Cards alternate (final deal of 4 cards, 6 never dealt) as an optional variant that can make the game unwinnable. Updated the cheat sheet so the standard rule is primary and the 4-card final deal is clearly labeled as alternate.</p>
<hr>
<h2>27. Spider: two-suited deck count; simplify suit variants</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When playing two-suited spider solitaire, how many cards to you use (or decks)
… Check your work. You&#39;re not making sense.
… OK update spider solitaire like this. When playing 1-suit, assume all cards are the same suit … When playing 2-suit, assume all red and all black belong to the same suit. In this way you can use two decks of cards for both variants.
… Simplify. Rules should specify 4-suit obviously, and then 2 and 1-suit just specify what a suit means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Corrected difficulty variants: all use <strong>two decks (104 cards)</strong>; only the meaning of &quot;suit&quot; for removing sequences changes. 4-suit = actual suit; 2-suit = red (hearts+diamonds) or black (spades+clubs); 1-suit = suit doesn&#39;t matter. Rewrote the main rules for 4-suit only; the variants section now only redefines &quot;suit&quot; for 2- and 1-suit, without repeated &quot;variant&quot; language.</p>
<hr>
<h2>28. Freecell and Eight Off cheat sheets</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a freecell overview in the patience folder
… Add one for eight-off baker&#39;s game</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>patience/freecell.md</code>: one deck, 8 columns (7+7+7+7+6+6+6+6), 4 free cells, build down alternating colors, foundations A→K by suit; moving sequences with empty cells/columns. Created <code>patience/eight-off.md</code>: like Freecell but 8 cells (4 pre-filled), build down <strong>by same suit</strong>; empty columns only for Kings; noted Baker&#39;s Game as 4 cells, same tableau as Freecell. Built both; index updated.</p>
<hr>
<h2>29. Klondike: seeding for winnable hands</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add a rule to [klondike] that suggests how to deal only winnable hands (or increase odds of success). For example, how to place aces in deck before dealing similar to how some board games seed events but keep it random
… Wouldn&#39;t you want aces in the last part of the deck, not the first? double check your work.
… Update so that aces are in the stock but you play with single card deals</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added a &quot;Seeding the deck (friendlier deals)&quot; section to <code>patience/klondike.md</code>. Explained deal order: first 28 cards = tableau, next 24 = stock; top of deck = seen first, bottom = bottom of stock (seen last), so Aces belong in the <strong>first</strong> part of the deck for early appearance. Then revised for <strong>single-card deals</strong> and <strong>Aces in the stock only</strong>: after dealing the tableau from 48 cards (Aces removed), build the 24-card stock and insert the 4 Aces at random in the first 12 positions so they appear in the first half when turning one card at a time; optional same for 2s in the first 16 stock positions. Removed the &quot;gentle option&quot; (one Ace in first 7). Rebuilt patience HTML.</p>
<hr>
<h2>30. Pinochle cheat sheet</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make a cheat sheet for pinochle</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>pinochle/pinochle.md</code> (and built <code>pinochle.html</code>): 48-card deck (two of 9–A per suit), 4 players in partnerships, target 250 (or 500). Documented deal, bidding (high bidder names trump), melding phase (marriages, runs, dix, pinochle, aces/kings/queens/jacks around with point table), trick play (card rank A-10-K-Q-J-9, follow suit, last trick +10), and making the bid (declarers need meld+tricks ≥ bid or lose bid amount). Added strategy tips. Index regenerated with pinochle section.</p>
<hr>
<h2>31. docs/history.md: trick-taking history and culture</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, add a history.md file in docs that: Covers the basic history of trick taking games; Has a bias towards euchre (as it relates to the others); Includes interesting and notable connections in the family tree of card games, trick taking, and as it relates to the general culture of american card playing; investigate, briefly, how immigration to the US impacts regional card game culture (especially ohio, michigan, indiana); make it interesting, accurate, and told in the style of popular epic fantasy/sci-fi (while staying correct and not over the top). It should read less like an encyclopedia and more like a fun biopic of card playing culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>docs/history.md</code>: narrative history of trick-taking from early European games (Karnöffel, tarot) through Whist (Hoyle, Crown Coffee House) and Bridge replacing it; Juckerspiel in Alsace/Palatinate → Euchre in America (Bauer → bower, Marsch → march, Joker from Euchre packs), spread via Midwest steamboats and German immigration; the &quot;Euchre Belt&quot; (Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan—Michigan as buckle) and family tradition; immigration and regional culture (German settlement, games as cultural luggage, Pinochle from Bezique/Binokel); family tree of Hearts, Spades, Bridge, Pinochle, Euchre. Written in an engaging, accurate narrative style rather than encyclopedic. No HTML build needed for docs unless build includes docs (build does include docs from discoverFolders).</p>
<hr>
<h2>32. Add citable sources to history.md</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update history.md with accurate and correct citaable sources (and urls when necessary) to back up the claims. update prompts.md accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Updated <code>docs/history.md</code> with numbered inline citations [1]–[12] keyed to a <strong>Sources</strong> section at the end. Added or confirmed: Wikipedia (trick-taking, tarot card games, Whist, contract bridge history, Jucker, Euchre, Pinochle, Hearts), Britannica (Edmond Hoyle), David Parlett’s euchre history (parlettgames.uk/histocs/euchre.html), Michigan Public (“Is Michigan the buckle of the euchre belt?”), and ClickOnDetroit (euchre in Michigan). Each source entry includes a short note on what it backs up and the URL. Narrative wording was lightly adjusted where needed (e.g. Biritch, 1850s for Joker, 1909 for Black Lady). This prompt added as section 32 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>33. Bower/&quot;bar&quot; regionalism (Ohio) and immigration link in history.md</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew up calling them &quot;bars&quot;. I found a website that had an asterisk … &quot;pronounced &#39;bowers&#39; except in western ohio where the local dialect says &#39;bars&#39;&quot; … do deep research on this, find the source … and add … draw parallels to immigration and if you can help me find out <em>why</em> this is</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Researched regional &quot;bar&quot; (right bar, left bar) for euchre trump jacks. Ohio Euchre terminology PDF lists &quot;Bower (AKA Bar)&quot; and notes bar as common in Ohio; AnandTech forum documents &quot;bar&quot; as regional (Ohio/traditional). Exact &quot;western Ohio&quot; asterisk wording not relocated. Added to <code>docs/history.md</code>: a paragraph in &quot;Jucker becomes Euchre&quot; after the bower/march etymology—in Ohio (especially western Ohio) many say &quot;bar&quot;; likely cause: oral transmission in German-heavy Ohio, with <em>Bauer</em> shortened in speech to &quot;bar.&quot; Two reflexes: &quot;bower&quot; in print, &quot;bar&quot; at the table. New sources [13]–[15]: Ohio Euchre PDF, AnandTech thread, Borf appendix note. This prompt added as section 33 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>34. Intro block on index (intro.md)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s create a &#39;intro.md&#39; that is used to inject into the top of &#39;index.html&#39; so that i can create some text on the main page explaining what&#39;s up with this project. fill the intro.md with a friendly intro, links to the readme/github, and a link to check out the prompts and history document.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Created <code>intro.md</code> at repo root with a short friendly intro (quick-reference rules for card games, Markdown built to HTML), links to the README and GitHub (placeholder URL for user to replace), and links to <code>docs/prompts.html</code> and <code>docs/history.html</code>. Updated <code>scripts/generate-index.js</code> to require <code>marked</code>, read <code>intro.md</code> when present, render it to HTML, and inject it in a <code>&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;</code> after the <code>&lt;h1&gt;Cheat Sheets&lt;/h1&gt;</code> in the generated index; added <code>.intro</code> styles. Index is regenerated when running the full build (<code>npm run build:all</code>). This prompt added as section 34 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>35. Citation hyperlinks in history.md</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Update history.md so that citation references link down to the section via hyperlink. Update prompts.md accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> In <code>docs/history.md</code>, each in-text citation (e.g. [1], [2], … [19]) was turned into a link to the corresponding entry in the <strong>Sources</strong> section: body citations use <code>[\[N\]](#source-N)</code> and each source line has <code>&lt;span id=&quot;source-N&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> before the number. Citations now jump to the correct source when clicked. Source 10 anchor was added where possible (curly apostrophe in title prevented one earlier attempt). This prompt added as section 35 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>36. Germans from Russia aside in history.md (Whist/Cribbage vs Euchre)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add to history.doc as an aside, but only if you can provide citable references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added an aside to <code>docs/history.md</code> in the Euchre Belt section: <strong>Germans from Russia</strong> (Volga and Black Sea) settled the Northern Plains (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota) in the 1870s onward—a different migration path than the Ohio/Mississippi Euchre Belt. In that region the default card games often weren’t Euchre: <strong>Minnesota Whist</strong> (brought by Norwegian immigrants) and <strong>Cribbage</strong> (English origin) took hold. New sources [16]–[19]: NDSU Germans from Russia Heritage Collection, Wikipedia Volga Germans, Wikipedia Minnesota whist, Wikipedia Cribbage. This prompt added as section 36 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>37. Cribbage deep dive in Minnesota (history.md)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go deeper on cribbage. Why is cribbage so deep in Minnesota, and how does it relate to immigration. Cite your references.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Added a paragraph <strong>“Why Cribbage runs deep in Minnesota”</strong> to <code>docs/history.md</code>: English origin (Suckling, 1630s); spread with English settlers, sailors, and fishermen (two-player game); in Canada/Great Lakes, cribbage among explorers, whalers, and fur trade (HBC); railway and work camps (e.g. CPR cribbage board 1880s, Thunder Bay); Wisconsin/Minnesota/Michigan concentration (Milwaukee 1841); Irish lumberjacks from Canada as one vector into the Upper Midwest. New sources [20]–[24]: MVHM History of Cribbage PDF, Canada’s History cribbage board, Thunder Bay Museum CPR cribbage, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Wisconsin/MN/MI), FamilySearch Minnesota Emigration and Immigration. This prompt added as section 37 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>38. Spades and Bid Whist in history.md (trick-taking family, immigration)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a story here about Spades? How does it relate to the family of trick taking games, and is there a tie into american immigration?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Expanded <code>docs/history.md</code> with a <strong>Spades</strong> paragraph: 20th-century American game in the Whist line (partnership, bidding, spades as trump); Cincinnati 1937–1939 (George Coffin), spread via WWII military and college campuses; now one of the most played partnership games in the US. <strong>Bid Whist</strong> described as a close relative with deep roots in <strong>African American</strong> culture: developed by enslaved people (Whist + Bridge), “Black bridge”; <strong>Pullman porters</strong> spread it; Black G.I.s played Spades and Bid Whist and brought both home. Immigration/migration tie: military, Great Migration, Black American community. Family tree sentence updated to include Bid Whist. New sources [25]–[27]: Wikipedia Spades, Wikipedia Bid whist, NPR “Rise and Fly: The Story of Bid Whist.” This prompt added as section 38 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>39. Bid Whist citation and pre–Civil War source (history.md)</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need a citation for bid whist being birthed from african american culture - it&#39;s an amazing fact and i want to make sure we get it right.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sources for bid whist are good but don&#39;t specifically call out pre-civil-war era. If you follow the wiki link to the black enterprise article, there&#39;s a more direcrt source. please use this … URL is here: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4EAAAAMBAJ&dq=Bid+whist&pg=PA208">https://books.google.com/books?id=cF4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Bid+whist&amp;pg=PA208</a> …</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary.</strong> Tightened and cited the Bid Whist origin in <code>docs/history.md</code>. (1) Added <em>Rise and Fly</em> (Morrison &amp; Lamb, 2005) as source [28] and attributed the slavery-era claim to oral tradition and cultural history documented in that book and in NPR. (2) Per user, added the <strong>Black Enterprise</strong> Nov 1999 article (&quot;Are you game for bid whist?&quot;) as source [29], citing <strong>Angel Beck&#39;s research</strong> (author of <em>How to Play Bid Whist</em>, syndicated bid whist columnist): the game has been a tradition <strong>since slavery (pre–Civil War)</strong>; enslaved people developed their own adaptation of the card games they saw white people playing, primarily bridge and whist. Narrative now leads with [29] and explicitly states &quot;slavery (pre–Civil War)&quot; before referencing [26]–[28]. This prompt added as section 39 in <code>docs/prompts.md</code>.</p>

<h2>40. CLAUDE.md example, audit, and prompts.md guidelines</h2>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create the example in @CLAUDE.md

(2) Audited <code>CLAUDE.md</code>: fixed subject–verb agreement in the Role line (&quot;your passion … are&quot; → &quot;your passion … and you are&quot;); confirmed Instruction, Parameter, and Example were consistent. (3) Added this entry (section 40) to document the full exchange and keep the prompt log complete.</p>
