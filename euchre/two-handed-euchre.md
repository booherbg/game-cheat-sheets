# Two-Handed Euchre Cheat Sheet

Euchre for 2 players. Same 24-card deck and card rankings as classic euchre, but with a different deal, trick-based bidding (similar to Spades), and 12 tricks per round. Each player has a hand plus face-up and face-down cards in front of them; you may play from your hand or from your face-up cards.

## Setup
- Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)
- Players: 2
- Card rankings and trump order same as standard euchre (right bower, left bower)

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal

All 24 cards are used. Each player ends up with:
- **4 cards in hand** (private)
- **4 cards face-down** in a row in front of them
- **4 cards face-up** on top of the face-down row

Dealing method: dealer gives one card to opponent’s layout, one to their own, and so on—building the face-down piles first, then placing face-up cards on top. Finally each player receives 4 cards for their hand. Both players can see all 8 exposed cards (their own 4 face-up and the opponent’s 4 face-up).

### 2. Bidding

- Bidding is like Spades: each player bids how many tricks they will take. **Minimum bid is 7 tricks.**
- Non-dealer bids first.
- Consider your hand and all 8 visible cards before bidding.
- The player who bids higher names the trump suit. Only that player (the “maker”) can score points for the round.

### 3. Playing

- **Non-dealer leads** to the first trick.
- **12 tricks** are played (all 24 cards).
- On your turn you play one card **either from your hand or from one of your face-up cards**.
- When you play a face-up card, **turn over the face-down card underneath it**; that card is now visible and can be played on a later trick.
- Follow suit if you can; otherwise you may play any card. Trump beats non-trump; otherwise highest card of the lead suit wins.
- Winner of each trick leads to the next.

### 4. Scoring

Only the maker scores for the round:
- Maker wins **7 tricks** → 1 point  
- **8 tricks** → 2 points  
- **9 tricks** → 3 points  
- … up to **12 tricks** → 6 points  

If the maker takes **fewer than 7 tricks**, they score **0** for the round.

**Game end:** First player to reach **10 points** wins.

## Trump Order (Low → High)

Same as standard euchre: jack of trump is highest (“right bower”), other jack of same color is second (“left bower”) and counts as trump.

♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ (J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> is second highest spades)
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span>

## Strategy Tips

- Keep some cards **out of sight**. If everything you have left is visible, your opponent can plan against it.
- Sometimes it’s better to **play a high face-up card** and expose the one under it—that card might be trump or otherwise useful.
- Use the visible layout (yours and opponent’s) when bidding and when deciding which card to play.
- Leading a non-trump ace is often strong; pull trump when you have control.

## Other Variation

Another 2-handed style: deal **5 cards** to each player plus **3 extra cards** that stay hidden until after trump is chosen. Bidding works like classic euchre (order up / call trump). After trump is set, both players look at their 3 extra cards and **choose the best 5-card hand** from their 8 cards. If the maker **goes alone**, they may not use the 3 extra cards and can score more points for a march.
