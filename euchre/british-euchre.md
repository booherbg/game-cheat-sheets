# British Euchre Cheat Sheet

Euchre with **one extra card**: a Joker (or **Benny** / **Best Bower**). Same as standard euchre for 4 players in 2 teams, except the deck has 25 cards and the Benny is always the **highest trump**—it beats the right bower. When the Benny is turned face-up as the potential trump card, the dealer (or dealer's team) chooses trump. Some play to **11 points** instead of 10.

## Setup
- Deck: 9–A in all four suits **plus one Joker** (25 cards). If no Joker is available, use the **2♠** as the Benny.
- Players: 4 (2 teams)
- Scoring: 6 & 4 cards (or play to 11 points)
- No table talk or signaling

----

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)
- **4 remaining cards** (one is the Benny when it’s not in play), flip top card = potential trump

### 2. Bidding (Choosing Trump)

**Round 1 — Order Up**
- Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise
- Each player: "order up" the face-up suit to the dealer or pass
- If ordered up: dealer picks up that card and discards one from their hand → trump is set, play begins
- **If the face-up card is the Benny:** The dealer (or dealer's team) **chooses trump**. The Benny is set aside; the dealer does not add it to their hand (or, by agreement, the dealer takes the Benny and discards one). Then play begins.
- "Going Alone": A player may try to take all 5 tricks without their partner (worth 4 points)

**Round 2 — Call Trump**
- If all pass, dealer flips the turn card down, bid continues clockwise: players may name any other suit as trump
- If all pass again, dealer must choose ("stick the dealer")

### 3. Playing
- Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)
- Play moves clockwise around the table
- Each player *must follow suit* if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump
- Trump always beats non-trump; **Benny beats everything in trump**
- Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

### 4. Scoring

Same as standard euchre:

- If the team that called trump gets 3+ tricks:
  - 3–4 tricks: 1 point
  - 5 tricks ("march"): 2 points
- If defending team gets 3 tricks: 2 points to defensive team (calling team got "euchred")
- Going alone + all 5 tricks: 4 points

Deal moves to the left (clockwise). Play until one team reaches **10 points** (or **11**, if agreed).

## Trump Order (Low → High) — with Benny

The **Benny (Joker)** is always the highest trump. Then come the right and left bowers, then A, K, Q, 10, 9 of trump.

- **Benny (Joker or 2♠)** — highest
- Right Bower (Jack of trump suit)
- Left Bower (Jack of same color)
- A, K, Q, 10, 9 of trump

The left bower still counts as trump, not its own suit (e.g. if diamonds are trump, J♥ is the left bower and ranks as a diamond).

## When the Benny Is Turned Face-Up

If the **Benny is the turn card**, it is not a suit. Common agreements:

- **Dealer chooses trump:** Dealer (or dealer's team) names trump. The Benny is set aside; dealer does not take it (or takes it and discards one, by agreement). No order-up / pass; trump is set by the dealer’s call.
- **Trump is Spades:** Treat the turn as spades; left of dealer may order up or pass as in normal euchre. If ordered up, dealer picks up the Benny (or a spade from the deck, depending on house rule) and discards one.
- **Blind bid:** Dealer must call trump **without looking at their hand**, then receives the Benny and discards one.

Agree before the first deal which rule you use.

## Strategy Tips
- Leading a non-trump ace is often strong
- The Benny is your top trump—use it to take a key trick or pull the last of the other side’s trump
- Euchre is about control, not just high cards
- If you expect 2 tricks and your partner can likely get 1 → call trump
- Pull enemy trump early when you have the Benny or strong trump
- Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play
- General rule: avoid trumping your partner's ace when they are winning the trick
