<h1>Call-Ace Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A variant of euchre for 4 to 6 players, all playing as individuals. The rules are the same as regular euchre except that instead of the maker having the option to play alone, they have the option to play with a partner. The maker does not choose a partner by name but says, &quot;I call upon the ace of (name of suit).&quot; The person holding that ace becomes the maker&#39;s partner. (Example: &quot;I call upon the ace of hearts&quot; — the player with the ace of hearts in hand is the maker&#39;s partner.) If no one was dealt the ace that the maker named, the maker plays without a partner. Uses the same trump and bower rules as regular euchre.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 4 to 6, all playing as individuals</li>
<li>Maker may have a partner (the holder of the called ace) or play alone</li>
<li>Partner identity is unknown until the called ace is played</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives cards according to player count (e.g., 5 players: 4 each, 4 in kitty; 6 players: 4 each; 4 players: 6 each)</li>
<li>Flip top card of remaining deck = potential trump</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding (Choosing Trump and Calling Partner)</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 — Order Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise</li>
<li>Each player: &quot;order up&quot; the face-up suit to the dealer or pass</li>
<li>If ordered up: dealer picks up card and discards one from their hand → trump is now set</li>
<li>Maker must then say, &quot;I call upon the ace of (suit)&quot; to call their partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 2 — Call Trump</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If all pass, dealer flips top card down, bid continues clockwise</li>
<li>Players may name any other suit as trump</li>
<li>If a player calls trump, they become the maker and must call upon the ace of a suit</li>
<li>If all pass again, dealer must choose (&quot;stick the dealer&quot;) and call upon an ace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calling Your Partner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maker says &quot;I call upon the ace of (hearts / diamonds / clubs / spades)&quot;</li>
<li>The player holding that ace becomes the maker&#39;s partner</li>
<li>Partner&#39;s identity is unknown until they play the called ace</li>
<li>If the maker holds that ace, they play alone (no partner)</li>
<li>If no one was dealt that ace (e.g. it is in the kitty), the maker plays without a partner</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>First Trick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner of previous trick leads</li>
<li>Each player <em>must follow suit</em> if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revealing Your Partner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the called ace is played, the partner&#39;s identity is revealed</li>
<li>Until then, players do not know who the partner is</li>
<li>Partner should try to help the maker without being obvious</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 5 tricks are finished, points are scored:</p>
<p><strong>If the maker plays alone (no partner):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>March (5 tricks): maker earns points equal to the number of players in the game (4, 5, or 6)</li>
<li>3 or 4 tricks: maker gets 1 point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If a partnership (maker + partner) gets 3+ tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>March (5 tricks): each partner earns the same number of points — 3 or 4 players = 2 points each; 5 or 6 players = 3 points each</li>
<li>3 or 4 tricks: each partner gets 1 point</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the maker or the maker&#39;s partnership is euchred (defenders take 3+ tricks):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each of the other players (everyone except maker, and except maker&#39;s partner if any) gets 2 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deal moves to the left (clockwise)</li>
<li>Play continues until one player reaches 10 points</li>
<li>First player to 10 points wins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the &quot;left bower&quot;) when diamonds is trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)

♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<p><strong>For the Maker:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call an ace you don&#39;t have (so you get a partner)</li>
<li>Call the ace of a suit that&#39;s likely to be in someone&#39;s hand</li>
<li>Consider calling the ace of trump if you have strong trump</li>
<li>Leading a non-trump ace is often strong</li>
<li>If you have a very strong hand, consider calling an ace you hold to play alone (you earn number-of-players points on a march)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the Partner (holder of the called ace):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to help the maker without being obvious</li>
<li>Don&#39;t reveal yourself too early unless necessary</li>
<li>Consider when to play the called ace strategically</li>
<li>Help the maker win tricks, but don&#39;t make it obvious you&#39;re the partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the Other Players:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to identify who the partner might be</li>
<li>Work together (tacitly) to euchre the maker — each of you gets 2 points if you do</li>
<li>Watch for unusual plays that might indicate partnership</li>
<li>If you suspect someone is the partner, try to force them to reveal themselves</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Euchre is about control, not just high cards</li>
<li>Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control</li>
<li>Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play</li>
<li>Being &quot;two suited&quot; is very powerful</li>
<li>General rule: avoid trumping your partner&#39;s ace if they are winning the trick</li>
<li>In call-ace, reading the table and identifying the partner is crucial</li>
</ul>
