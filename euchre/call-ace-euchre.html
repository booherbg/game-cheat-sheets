<h1>Call-Ace Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A variant of euchre for 5 players where the caller names a specific card (usually an ace) and whoever holds that card becomes their secret partner. The partner&#39;s identity remains hidden until they play the called card. Uses the same trump and bower rules as regular euchre.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 5 (sometimes 6 with jokers)</li>
<li>Scoring: Caller and partner vs. other 3 players</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
<li>Partner identity is secret until called card is played</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 4 cards each (2/2 alternating or any fair deal)</li>
<li>4 remaining cards, flip top card = potential trump</li>
<li>With 5 players, each gets 4 cards, 4 cards remain in kitty</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding (Choosing Trump and Calling Partner)</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 — Order Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise</li>
<li>Each player: &quot;order up&quot; the face-up suit to the dealer or pass</li>
<li>If ordered up: dealer picks up card and discards one from their hand → trump is now set</li>
<li>Caller must then name a card (usually an ace) to call their partner</li>
<li>Example: &quot;Ace of spades&quot; or &quot;King of hearts&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 2 — Call Trump</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If all pass, dealer flips top card down, bid continues clockwise</li>
<li>Players may name any other suit as trump</li>
<li>If a player calls trump, they must also name a card to call their partner</li>
<li>If all pass again, dealer must choose (&quot;stick the dealer&quot;) and call a partner card</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Calling Your Partner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Caller names a specific card (e.g., &quot;Ace of spades&quot;, &quot;King of hearts&quot;)</li>
<li>The player holding that card becomes the caller&#39;s partner</li>
<li>Partner&#39;s identity is secret until they play the called card</li>
<li>If caller holds the called card themselves, they play alone (no partner)</li>
<li>If called card is in the kitty (undealt cards), caller plays alone</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>First Trick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner of previous trick leads</li>
<li>Each player <em>must follow suit</em> if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revealing Your Partner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When the called card is played, the partner&#39;s identity is revealed</li>
<li>Until then, players must guess who the partner might be</li>
<li>Partner should try to help caller without being obvious</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 5 tricks are finished, teams score points:</p>
<p><strong>If caller&#39;s team (caller + partner) gets 3+ tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3-4 tricks: 1 point each to caller and partner</li>
<li>5 tricks (&quot;march&quot;): 2 points each to caller and partner</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If defenders get 3+ tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 points each to the 3 defenders (caller&#39;s team got &quot;euchred&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If caller plays alone (no partner):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3-4 tricks: 1 point</li>
<li>5 tricks: 4 points</li>
<li>If euchred: 2 points each to the 4 defenders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deal moves to the left (clockwise)</li>
<li>Play continues until one player reaches 10 points</li>
<li>First player to 10 points wins</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the &quot;left bower&quot;) when diamonds is trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)

♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<p><strong>For the Caller:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call a card you don&#39;t have (so you get a partner)</li>
<li>Call a high card (ace or king) that&#39;s likely to be in someone&#39;s hand</li>
<li>Consider calling a card in the trump suit if you have strong trump</li>
<li>Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong</li>
<li>Watch for signals from potential partners before the called card is revealed</li>
<li>If you have a very strong hand, consider calling a card you hold to play alone</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the Secret Partner:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to help the caller without being obvious</li>
<li>Don&#39;t reveal yourself too early unless necessary</li>
<li>If you have the called card, consider when to play it strategically</li>
<li>Help the caller win tricks, but don&#39;t make it obvious you&#39;re the partner</li>
<li>If you can win a trick the caller needs, do it subtly</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Defenders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to identify who the partner might be</li>
<li>Work together (tacitly) to euchre the caller</li>
<li>Watch for unusual plays that might indicate partnership</li>
<li>If you suspect someone is the partner, try to force them to reveal themselves</li>
<li>Don&#39;t waste high cards if you&#39;re not sure who the partner is</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General Strategy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Euchre is about control, not just high cards</li>
<li>Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control</li>
<li>Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play</li>
<li>Being &quot;two suited&quot; is very powerful</li>
<li>General rule: avoid trumping your partner&#39;s ace if they are winning the trick</li>
<li>In call-ace, reading the table and identifying the partner is crucial</li>
<li>If you&#39;re the partner, balance helping with not being obvious</li>
</ul>
