<h1>Two-Handed Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Euchre for 2 players. Same 24-card deck and card rankings as classic euchre, but with a different deal, trick-based bidding (similar to Spades), and 12 tricks per round. Each player has a hand plus face-up and face-down cards in front of them; you may play from your hand or from your face-up cards.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 2</li>
<li>Card rankings and trump order same as standard euchre (right bower, left bower)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<p>All 24 cards are used. Each player ends up with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4 cards in hand</strong> (private)</li>
<li><strong>4 cards face-down</strong> in a row in front of them</li>
<li><strong>4 cards face-up</strong> on top of the face-down row</li>
</ul>
<p>Dealing method: dealer gives one card to opponent’s layout, one to their own, and so on—building the face-down piles first, then placing face-up cards on top. Finally each player receives 4 cards for their hand. Both players can see all 8 exposed cards (their own 4 face-up and the opponent’s 4 face-up).</p>
<h3>2. Bidding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bidding is like Spades: each player bids how many tricks they will take. <strong>Minimum bid is 7 tricks.</strong></li>
<li>Non-dealer bids first.</li>
<li>Consider your hand and all 8 visible cards before bidding.</li>
<li>The player who bids higher names the trump suit. Only that player (the “maker”) can score points for the round.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-dealer leads</strong> to the first trick.</li>
<li><strong>12 tricks</strong> are played (all 24 cards).</li>
<li>On your turn you play one card <strong>either from your hand or from one of your face-up cards</strong>.</li>
<li>When you play a face-up card, <strong>turn over the face-down card underneath it</strong>; that card is now visible and can be played on a later trick.</li>
<li>Follow suit if you can; otherwise you may play any card. Trump beats non-trump; otherwise highest card of the lead suit wins.</li>
<li>Winner of each trick leads to the next.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>Only the maker scores for the round:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maker wins <strong>7 tricks</strong> → 1 point  </li>
<li><strong>8 tricks</strong> → 2 points  </li>
<li><strong>9 tricks</strong> → 3 points  </li>
<li>… up to <strong>12 tricks</strong> → 6 points</li>
</ul>
<p>If the maker takes <strong>fewer than 7 tricks</strong>, they score <strong>0</strong> for the round.</p>
<p><strong>Game end:</strong> First player to reach <strong>10 points</strong> wins.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Same as standard euchre: jack of trump is highest (“right bower”), other jack of same color is second (“left bower”) and counts as trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)
<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Hearts:   9<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♥</span> K<span style="color:red;">♥</span> A<span style="color:red;">♥</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> J<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> is second highest hearts)
♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ (J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> is second highest spades)
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep some cards <strong>out of sight</strong>. If everything you have left is visible, your opponent can plan against it.</li>
<li>Sometimes it’s better to <strong>play a high face-up card</strong> and expose the one under it—that card might be trump or otherwise useful.</li>
<li>Use the visible layout (yours and opponent’s) when bidding and when deciding which card to play.</li>
<li>Leading a non-trump ace is often strong; pull trump when you have control.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Other Variation</h2>
<p>Another 2-handed style: deal <strong>5 cards</strong> to each player plus <strong>3 extra cards</strong> that stay hidden until after trump is chosen. Bidding works like classic euchre (order up / call trump). After trump is set, both players look at their 3 extra cards and <strong>choose the best 5-card hand</strong> from their 8 cards. If the maker <strong>goes alone</strong>, they may not use the 3 extra cards and can score more points for a march.</p>
