# Call-Ace Euchre Cheat Sheet

A variant of euchre for 5 players where the caller names a specific card (usually an ace) and whoever holds that card becomes their secret partner. The partner's identity remains hidden until they play the called card. Uses the same trump and bower rules as regular euchre.

## Setup
- Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)
- Players: 5 (sometimes 6 with jokers)
- Scoring: Caller and partner vs. other 3 players
- No table talk or signaling
- Partner identity is secret until called card is played

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 4 cards each (2/2 alternating or any fair deal)
- 4 remaining cards, flip top card = potential trump
- With 5 players, each gets 4 cards, 4 cards remain in kitty

### 2. Bidding (Choosing Trump and Calling Partner)

**Round 1 — Order Up**
- Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise
- Each player: "order up" the face-up suit to the dealer or pass
- If ordered up: dealer picks up card and discards one from their hand → trump is now set
- Caller must then name a card (usually an ace) to call their partner
- Example: "Ace of spades" or "King of hearts"

**Round 2 — Call Trump**
- If all pass, dealer flips top card down, bid continues clockwise
- Players may name any other suit as trump
- If a player calls trump, they must also name a card to call their partner
- If all pass again, dealer must choose ("stick the dealer") and call a partner card

**Calling Your Partner:**
- Caller names a specific card (e.g., "Ace of spades", "King of hearts")
- The player holding that card becomes the caller's partner
- Partner's identity is secret until they play the called card
- If caller holds the called card themselves, they play alone (no partner)
- If called card is in the kitty (undealt cards), caller plays alone

### 3. Playing

**First Trick:**
- Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)
- Play moves clockwise around the table

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- Winner of previous trick leads
- Each player *must follow suit* if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump
- Trump always beats non-trump
- Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

**Revealing Your Partner:**
- When the called card is played, the partner's identity is revealed
- Until then, players must guess who the partner might be
- Partner should try to help caller without being obvious

### 4. Scoring

After all 5 tricks are finished, teams score points:

**If caller's team (caller + partner) gets 3+ tricks:**
- 3-4 tricks: 1 point each to caller and partner
- 5 tricks ("march"): 2 points each to caller and partner

**If defenders get 3+ tricks:**
- 2 points each to the 3 defenders (caller's team got "euchred")

**If caller plays alone (no partner):**
- 3-4 tricks: 1 point
- 5 tricks: 4 points
- If euchred: 2 points each to the 4 defenders

**Game End:**
- Deal moves to the left (clockwise)
- Play continues until one player reaches 10 points
- First player to 10 points wins

## Trump Order (Low → High)

Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the "left bower") when diamonds is trump.

## Strategy Tips

**For the Caller:**
- Call a card you don't have (so you get a partner)
- Call a high card (ace or king) that's likely to be in someone's hand
- Consider calling a card in the trump suit if you have strong trump
- Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong
- Watch for signals from potential partners before the called card is revealed
- If you have a very strong hand, consider calling a card you hold to play alone

**For the Secret Partner:**
- Try to help the caller without being obvious
- Don't reveal yourself too early unless necessary
- If you have the called card, consider when to play it strategically
- Help the caller win tricks, but don't make it obvious you're the partner
- If you can win a trick the caller needs, do it subtly

**For Defenders:**
- Try to identify who the partner might be
- Work together (tacitly) to euchre the caller
- Watch for unusual plays that might indicate partnership
- If you suspect someone is the partner, try to force them to reveal themselves
- Don't waste high cards if you're not sure who the partner is

**General Strategy:**
- Euchre is about control, not just high cards
- Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control
- Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play
- Being "two suited" is very powerful
- General rule: avoid trumping your partner's ace if they are winning the trick
- In call-ace, reading the table and identifying the partner is crucial
- If you're the partner, balance helping with not being obvious
