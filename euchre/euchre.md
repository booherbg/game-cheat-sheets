# Euchre Cheat Sheet

A trick taking card game where farmers run the show. The key with this game is that the Jack of trump suit is the highest card ("right bower"), and the other jack of the same color is the second highest trump card ("left bower").

## Setup
- Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)
- Players: 4 (2 teams)
- Scoring: 6 & 4 cards
- No table talk or signaling

----

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)
- 4 remaining cards, flip top card = potential trump

### 2. Bidding (Choosing Trump)
- Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise

**Round 1 — Order Up**
- Each player: "order up" the face-up suit to the dealer or pass
- If ordered up: dealer picks up card and discards one from their hand → trump is now set, play begins
- "Going Alone": A player attempts to go for all 5 tricks without their partner (worth 4 points)

**Round 2 — Call Trump**
- If all pass, dealer flips top card down, bid continues clockwise: players may name any other suit as trump
- If all pass again, dealer must choose ("stick the dealer")

### 3. Playing
- Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)
- Play moves clockwise around the teable
- Each player *must follow suit* if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump
- Trump always beats non-trump
- Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

### 4. Scoring

After all 5 tricks are finished, one team wins points as follows:

- If the team that called trump gets 3+ tricks:
    - 3-4 tricks: 1 point
    - 5 tricks ("march"): 2 points
- If defending team gets 3 tricks: 2 points to defensive team (calling team got "euchred")
- Going alone + all 5 tricks: 4 points

Deal moves to the left (clockwise), play continues until one team wins 10 points; use 6 & 4 cards to track score

## Trump Order (Low → High)

Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the "left bower") when diamonds is trump.

## Strategy Tips
- Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong
- Euchre is about control, not just high cards
- If you expect 2 tricks and your partner can likely get 1 → call trump
- Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control
- Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play
- Being "two suited" is very powerful
- General rule: avoid trumping your partner's ace if they are winning the trick
