<h1>Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A trick taking card game where farmers run the show. The key with this game is that the Jack of trump suit is the highest card (&quot;right bower&quot;), and the other jack of the same color is the second highest trump card (&quot;left bower&quot;).</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 4 (2 teams)</li>
<li>Scoring: 6 &amp; 4 cards</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)</li>
<li>4 remaining cards, flip top card = potential trump</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding (Choosing Trump)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 1 — Order Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each player: &quot;order up&quot; the face-up suit to the dealer or pass</li>
<li>If ordered up: dealer picks up card and discards one from their hand → trump is now set, play begins</li>
<li>&quot;Going Alone&quot;: A player attempts to go for all 5 tricks without their partner (worth 4 points)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 2 — Call Trump</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If all pass, dealer flips top card down, bid continues clockwise: players may name any other suit as trump</li>
<li>If all pass again, dealer must choose (&quot;stick the dealer&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the teable</li>
<li>Each player <em>must follow suit</em> if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<!-- <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> -->

<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 5 tricks are finished, one team wins points as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the team that called trump gets 3+ tricks:<ul>
<li>3-4 tricks: 1 point</li>
<li>5 tricks (&quot;march&quot;): 2 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If defending team gets 3 tricks: 2 points to defensive team (calling team got &quot;euchred&quot;)</li>
<li>Going alone + all 5 tricks: 4 points</li>
</ul>
<p>Deal moves to the left (clockwise), play continues until one team wins 10 points; use 6 &amp; 4 cards to track score</p>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the &quot;left bower&quot;) when diamonds is trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)
<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Hearts:   9<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♥</span> K<span style="color:red;">♥</span> A<span style="color:red;">♥</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> J<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> is second highest hearts)
♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ (J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> is second highest spades)
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong</li>
<li>Euchre is about control, not just high cards</li>
<li>If you expect 2 tricks and your partner can likely get 1 → call trump</li>
<li>Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control</li>
<li>Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play</li>
<li>Being &quot;two suited&quot; is very powerful</li>
<li>General rule: avoid trumping your partner&#39;s ace if they are winning the trick</li>
</ul>
