<h1>Bid Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>A trick-taking variant of euchre where players bid individually on how many tricks they&#39;ll take. The highest bidder chooses trump and must meet their bid to score points. Uses the same trump rules as regular euchre with the right and left bowers.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 4 (individual play, no teams)</li>
<li>Scoring: Players bid tricks and must meet their bid</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)</li>
<li>4 remaining cards set aside (not used)</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding</h3>
<p><strong>Bidding Process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise</li>
<li>Each player bids how many tricks they will take (0-5)</li>
<li>Players can pass or increase the bid</li>
<li>Highest bidder wins the bid and chooses trump suit</li>
<li>If all players pass, dealer must bid at least 1 (&quot;stick the dealer&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bid Values:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimum bid is 1 trick</li>
<li>Maximum bid is 5 tricks (all tricks)</li>
<li>Players must bid higher than the current high bid to stay in</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>First Trick:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the table</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Subsequent Tricks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Winner of previous trick leads</li>
<li>Each player <em>must follow suit</em> if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump</li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>After all 5 tricks are finished, players score points:</p>
<p><strong>If bidder meets or exceeds their bid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 points per trick bid</li>
<li>1 point per overtrick (trick taken beyond the bid)</li>
<li>Example: Bid 3, take 4 tricks = 30 + 1 = 31 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If bidder fails to meet their bid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>-10 points per trick bid</li>
<li>Example: Bid 3, take 2 tricks = -30 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-bidders:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5 points per trick taken (regardless of who bid)</li>
<li>Example: Take 2 tricks = 10 points</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game End:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First player to reach 50 points wins</li>
<li>If multiple players reach 50 in the same hand, highest score wins</li>
<li>If tied, play continues until one player has a higher score</li>
</ul>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the &quot;left bower&quot;) when diamonds is trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)
<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Hearts:   9<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♥</span> K<span style="color:red;">♥</span> A<span style="color:red;">♥</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> J<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> is second highest hearts)
♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ (J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> is second highest spades)
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bid conservatively—it&#39;s better to bid 2 and make 3 than to bid 3 and make 2</li>
<li>Count your sure tricks before bidding</li>
<li>If you have right bower, left bower, and an ace, you can likely bid 3</li>
<li>Watch what others are bidding—high bids mean strong hands</li>
<li>If you&#39;re not bidding, try to prevent the bidder from making their bid</li>
<li>Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong</li>
<li>Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control</li>
<li>If you&#39;re the bidder, choose trump based on your strongest suit</li>
<li>Non-bidders should work together (tacitly) to euchre the bidder</li>
<li>Being &quot;two suited&quot; is very powerful for bidding</li>
<li>In bid euchre, there are no partners—everyone plays for themselves</li>
<li>If you have a weak hand, bid low or pass to let others bid</li>
<li>Track which high cards have been played to better estimate your trick potential</li>
</ul>
