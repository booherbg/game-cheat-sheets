# Bid Euchre Cheat Sheet

A trick-taking variant of euchre where players bid individually on how many tricks they'll take. The highest bidder chooses trump and must meet their bid to score points. Uses the same trump rules as regular euchre with the right and left bowers.

## Setup
- Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)
- Players: 4 (individual play, no teams)
- Scoring: Players bid tricks and must meet their bid
- No table talk or signaling

----

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)
- 4 remaining cards set aside (not used)

### 2. Bidding

**Bidding Process:**
- Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise
- Each player bids how many tricks they will take (0-5)
- Players can pass or increase the bid
- Highest bidder wins the bid and chooses trump suit
- If all players pass, dealer must bid at least 1 ("stick the dealer")

**Bid Values:**
- Minimum bid is 1 trick
- Maximum bid is 5 tricks (all tricks)
- Players must bid higher than the current high bid to stay in

### 3. Playing

**First Trick:**
- Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)
- Play moves clockwise around the table

**Subsequent Tricks:**
- Winner of previous trick leads
- Each player *must follow suit* if possible
- If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump
- Trump always beats non-trump
- Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins
- Player who won last trick leads next trick

### 4. Scoring

After all 5 tricks are finished, players score points:

**If bidder meets or exceeds their bid:**
- 10 points per trick bid
- 1 point per overtrick (trick taken beyond the bid)
- Example: Bid 3, take 4 tricks = 30 + 1 = 31 points

**If bidder fails to meet their bid:**
- -10 points per trick bid
- Example: Bid 3, take 2 tricks = -30 points

**Non-bidders:**
- 5 points per trick taken (regardless of who bid)
- Example: Take 2 tricks = 10 points

**Game End:**
- First player to reach 50 points wins
- If multiple players reach 50 in the same hand, highest score wins
- If tied, play continues until one player has a higher score

## Trump Order (Low → High)

Remember: Jack of the trump suit is the highest card, the other jack of the same color is second highest and is considered to be of the trump suit. ie: if diamonds is trump, jack of hearts plays as a DIAMONDS card, not hearts. In this example, if hearts are lead and a player only has the jack of hearts but no other hearts, they do not have to follow suit because the jack of hearts belongs to the diamonds suit (as the "left bower") when diamonds is trump.

## Strategy Tips
- Bid conservatively—it's better to bid 2 and make 3 than to bid 3 and make 2
- Count your sure tricks before bidding
- If you have right bower, left bower, and an ace, you can likely bid 3
- Watch what others are bidding—high bids mean strong hands
- If you're not bidding, try to prevent the bidder from making their bid
- Leading a non-trump Ace is often strong
- Pull enemy trump early if you have strong control
- If you're the bidder, choose trump based on your strongest suit
- Non-bidders should work together (tacitly) to euchre the bidder
- Being "two suited" is very powerful for bidding
- In bid euchre, there are no partners—everyone plays for themselves
- If you have a weak hand, bid low or pass to let others bid
- Track which high cards have been played to better estimate your trick potential
