<h1>British Euchre Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Euchre with <strong>one extra card</strong>: a Joker (or <strong>Benny</strong> / <strong>Best Bower</strong>). Same as standard euchre for 4 players in 2 teams, except the deck has 25 cards and the Benny is always the <strong>highest trump</strong>—it beats the right bower. When the Benny is turned face-up as the potential trump card, the dealer (or dealer&#39;s team) chooses trump. Some play to <strong>11 points</strong> instead of 10.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A in all four suits <strong>plus one Joker</strong> (25 cards). If no Joker is available, use the <strong>2♠</strong> as the Benny.</li>
<li>Players: 4 (2 teams)</li>
<li>Scoring: 6 &amp; 4 cards (or play to 11 points)</li>
<li>No table talk or signaling</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives 5 cards each (2/3 alternating or any fair deal)</li>
<li><strong>4 remaining cards</strong> (one is the Benny when it’s not in play), flip top card = potential trump</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding (Choosing Trump)</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 — Order Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer starts the bid, moves clockwise</li>
<li>Each player: &quot;order up&quot; the face-up suit to the dealer or pass</li>
<li>If ordered up: dealer picks up that card and discards one from their hand → trump is set, play begins</li>
<li><strong>If the face-up card is the Benny:</strong> The dealer (or dealer&#39;s team) <strong>chooses trump</strong>. The Benny is set aside; the dealer does not add it to their hand (or, by agreement, the dealer takes the Benny and discards one). Then play begins.</li>
<li>&quot;Going Alone&quot;: A player may try to take all 5 tricks without their partner (worth 4 points)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Round 2 — Call Trump</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If all pass, dealer flips the turn card down, bid continues clockwise: players may name any other suit as trump</li>
<li>If all pass again, dealer must choose (&quot;stick the dealer&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer leads (plays any single card)</li>
<li>Play moves clockwise around the table</li>
<li>Each player <em>must follow suit</em> if possible</li>
<li>If unable to follow suit: may play any card or trump</li>
<li>Trump always beats non-trump; <strong>Benny beats everything in trump</strong></li>
<li>Otherwise highest card of lead suit wins</li>
<li>Player who won last trick leads next trick</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>Same as standard euchre:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the team that called trump gets 3+ tricks:<ul>
<li>3–4 tricks: 1 point</li>
<li>5 tricks (&quot;march&quot;): 2 points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If defending team gets 3 tricks: 2 points to defensive team (calling team got &quot;euchred&quot;)</li>
<li>Going alone + all 5 tricks: 4 points</li>
</ul>
<p>Deal moves to the left (clockwise). Play until one team reaches <strong>10 points</strong> (or <strong>11</strong>, if agreed).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Trump Order (Low → High) — with Benny</h2>
<p>The <strong>Benny (Joker)</strong> is always the highest trump. Then come the right and left bowers, then A, K, Q, 10, 9 of trump.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Benny (Joker or 2♠)</strong> — highest</li>
<li>Right Bower (Jack of trump suit)</li>
<li>Left Bower (Jack of same color)</li>
<li>A, K, Q, 10, 9 of trump</li>
</ul>
<p>The left bower still counts as trump, not its own suit (e.g. if diamonds are trump, J♥ is the left bower and ranks as a diamond).</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> <b>Benny</b> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is left bower)
<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Hearts:   9<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♥</span> K<span style="color:red;">♥</span> A<span style="color:red;">♥</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> J<span style="color:red;">♥</span> <b>Benny</b>
♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ <b>Benny</b>
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ <b>Benny</b>
</span></p>
<h2>When the Benny Is Turned Face-Up</h2>
<p>If the <strong>Benny is the turn card</strong>, it is not a suit. Common agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dealer chooses trump:</strong> Dealer (or dealer&#39;s team) names trump. The Benny is set aside; dealer does not take it (or takes it and discards one, by agreement). No order-up / pass; trump is set by the dealer’s call.</li>
<li><strong>Trump is Spades:</strong> Treat the turn as spades; left of dealer may order up or pass as in normal euchre. If ordered up, dealer picks up the Benny (or a spade from the deck, depending on house rule) and discards one.</li>
<li><strong>Blind bid:</strong> Dealer must call trump <strong>without looking at their hand</strong>, then receives the Benny and discards one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agree before the first deal which rule you use.</p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Leading a non-trump ace is often strong</li>
<li>The Benny is your top trump—use it to take a key trick or pull the last of the other side’s trump</li>
<li>Euchre is about control, not just high cards</li>
<li>If you expect 2 tricks and your partner can likely get 1 → call trump</li>
<li>Pull enemy trump early when you have the Benny or strong trump</li>
<li>Aggressive calling wins more games than passive play</li>
<li>General rule: avoid trumping your partner&#39;s ace when they are winning the trick</li>
</ul>
