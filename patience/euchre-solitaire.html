<h1>Euchre Solitaire Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Solo euchre against the deck. You get five cards and one card is turned for trump; you must either order up that suit or name another trump. You lead first. When you lead, the deck turns cards from the top until it can follow suit or play trump—that card is the deck&#39;s play, so the deck may use several cards in one trick. When the deck leads, you must follow suit if you can. Scoring matches classic two-handed euchre: 3–4 tricks = 1 point, march = 2, euchred = 2 for the deck; going alone pays 4 or costs 4. First to 10 wins.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: 9–A only (24 cards)</li>
<li>Players: 1 (you vs. the deck)</li>
<li>Card rankings and trump order same as standard euchre (right bower, left bower)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deal yourself <strong>5 cards</strong>. Turn <strong>one card</strong> face-up on top of the remaining deck (potential trump).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Choose Trump</h3>
<p>You must do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Order up:</strong> The turned card&#39;s suit is trump. Turn that card face-down on top of the deck.</li>
<li><strong>Name trump:</strong> Choose a different suit as trump. Put the turned card on the <strong>bottom</strong> of the deck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trump is now set. The rest of the deck is your opponent for the round.</p>
<h3>3. Playing</h3>
<p><strong>You lead to the first trick.</strong> Then:</p>
<p><strong>When you lead to a trick:</strong> The deck plays from the top. Turn cards face-up <strong>one at a time</strong> until you turn a card that <strong>follows suit or is trump</strong>. That card is the deck&#39;s play for the trick. (Cards turned before it are effectively used and no longer in play—the deck can run out of cards this way.)</p>
<p><strong>When the deck wins the trick:</strong> The deck <strong>leads the next trick</strong> by exposing its top card (one card).</p>
<p><strong>When the deck leads:</strong> You must <strong>follow suit if you can</strong>; otherwise you may play any card. Normal trick rules: trump beats non-trump; otherwise highest card of the lead suit wins.</p>
<p><strong>If the deck runs out of cards</strong> (because it burned through many cards when you led): You win all <strong>remaining tricks</strong> automatically.</p>
<p>You play <strong>5 tricks</strong> per deal. Higher card of the lead suit wins, or trump beats non-trump.</p>
<h3>4. Scoring</h3>
<p>Score is you vs. the deck. Only one side scores per deal.</p>
<p><strong>If you take 3 or more tricks (no &quot;go alone&quot;):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3–4 tricks: <strong>you get 1 point</strong></li>
<li>5 tricks (march): <strong>you get 2 points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are euchred (2 or fewer tricks):</strong> The <strong>deck gets 2 points</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Going alone:</strong> Before the first trick you may declare you are going alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must win <strong>all 5 tricks</strong> to score <strong>4 points</strong>.</li>
<li>If you lose even one trick, you are euchred: the <strong>deck gets 4 points</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game end:</strong> Play deals until <strong>you or the deck reaches 10 points</strong>. That side wins. (The deck scores only when it euchres you.)</p>

<h2>Trump Order (Low → High)</h2>
<p>Same as standard euchre: jack of trump is highest, other jack of same color is second-highest trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: monospace; white-space: pre;"><span style="color:red;">♦</span> Diamonds: 9<span style="color:red;">♦</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♦</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♦</span> K<span style="color:red;">♦</span> A<span style="color:red;">♦</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> J<span style="color:red;">♦</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♥</span> is second highest diamonds)
<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Hearts:   9<span style="color:red;">♥</span> 10<span style="color:red;">♥</span> Q<span style="color:red;">♥</span> K<span style="color:red;">♥</span> A<span style="color:red;">♥</span> J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> J<span style="color:red;">♥</span> (J<span style="color:purple;">♦</span> is second highest hearts)
♠ Spades:   9♠ 10♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠ J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> J♠ (J<span style="color:purple;">♣</span> is second highest spades)
♣ Clubs:    9♣ 10♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> J♣ (J<span style="color:purple;">♠</span> is second highest clubs)
</span></p>
<h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you lead, the deck will burn cards until it can follow or trump—use that to empty the deck of key cards or to force it to use high trumps early.</li>
<li>Leading trump (especially high trump) can strip the deck and make later tricks easier.</li>
<li>Going alone is high risk (deck gets 4 if you fail); only declare it with very strong, controllable hands.</li>
<li>If the deck is low on cards, leading in a way that forces multiple turnovers can make it run out so you claim the rest.</li>
<li>Order up when the turn card helps your hand; name another suit when your hand is strong in a different suit.</li>
</ul>
