<h1>Klondike Solitaire Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Klondike is the classic &quot;solitaire&quot; game—the one most people mean when they say &quot;solitaire.&quot; One-player patience: build four foundations up by suit from Ace to King, and build the tableau down in alternating colors. Turn cards from the stock (usually in groups of three) to the waste; only the top card of the waste is playable. Win by moving all 52 cards to the foundations.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: standard 52 cards</li>
<li>Players: 1</li>
<li><strong>Tableau:</strong> 7 columns. Column 1 has 1 card, column 2 has 2, … column 7 has 7. Only the top card of each column is face-up; the rest are face-down.</li>
<li><strong>Foundations:</strong> 4 empty piles (built up by suit, A→K).</li>
<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Remaining 24 cards, face-down.</li>
<li><strong>Waste:</strong> Face-up pile(s) for cards turned from the stock.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>Tableau</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build <strong>down</strong> in <strong>alternating colors</strong> (e.g. black 5 on red 6, red Q on black K).</li>
<li>You may move a <strong>single card</strong> or a <strong>complete sequence</strong> of face-up cards as a unit.</li>
<li>Only a <strong>King</strong> (or a sequence headed by a King) may be placed in an <strong>empty column</strong>.</li>
<li>When you move all face-up cards off a column, <strong>turn the next card face-up</strong>; it is now in play.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Foundations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move <strong>Aces</strong> to the foundations as they become available.</li>
<li>On each foundation, build <strong>up by suit</strong> in order: A, 2, 3, … K. Only the next higher card of the same suit may be added.</li>
<li>Cards in the foundations are out of play.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stock and waste</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turn cards from the <strong>stock</strong> onto the <strong>waste</strong>. Common rule: turn <strong>three cards at a time</strong>; only the <strong>top card</strong> of the waste may be played to the tableau or foundations.</li>
<li>If the top card is played, the next card down becomes playable.</li>
<li>When the stock is empty, <strong>turn the waste pile over</strong> (without shuffling) to form a new stock. Many rules allow <strong>one or three redeals</strong> (passes through the deck); some allow unlimited redeals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winning</h3>
<ul>
<li>You win when all four foundations are complete (Ace through King in each suit).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Variants (notes)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draw one:</strong> Turn one card at a time from the stock instead of three. Easier; often no redeal or one redeal.</li>
<li><strong>Draw three:</strong> Standard; one or three redeals are common.</li>
<li><strong>No redeal:</strong> Stock may be run through only once. Harder.</li>
<li><strong>Empty tableau:</strong> Some allow any card (not only a King) in an empty column; this is a different, easier game.</li>
<li><strong>Visible stock:</strong> Some play with the stock face-up so you can see the next card(s) before turning.</li>
<li><strong>Forty Thieves, Yukon, etc.:</strong> Other patience games use different layouts and rules; see separate cheat sheets if added.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Seeding the deck (friendlier deals)</h2>
<p>Use <strong>single-card deals</strong> (turn one card at a time from the stock). Aces and deuces that appear early in the stock are easier to build on; when they’re buried near the bottom of the stock, many deals are unwinnable. You can <strong>seed</strong> the deck so Aces (and optionally 2s) sit in the <strong>stock</strong> and show up early when you turn one card at a time. Optional; agree before play.</p>
<p><strong>Deal order:</strong> The first 28 cards go to the tableau, the next 24 form the stock. You turn from the <strong>top</strong> of the stock, one card at a time. So the first cards in the stock are seen early; the last cards in the stock are seen late. Seed Aces into the <strong>first part of the stock</strong> so they appear in the first half of your run through the deck.</p>
<p><strong>Simple seeding (Aces in the stock):</strong> Shuffle the deck. Remove the <strong>four Aces</strong> and set them aside. Shuffle the remaining 48 cards. <strong>Deal the tableau</strong> from the top (first 28 cards). The remaining 20 cards will form most of the stock; add the 4 Aces so the stock has 24 cards. <strong>Insert each Ace</strong> at a random position in the <strong>first 12 cards</strong> of that stock (e.g. take the 20 cards, randomly place the 4 Aces among the first 12 positions, then place the remaining 8 cards after them). Stack the stock in that order. When you play with single-card deals, the Aces will tend to appear in the first half of the stock.</p>
<p><strong>Stronger seeding:</strong> Do the same for the <strong>four 2s</strong>—place them at random in the first 16 cards of the stock (after building the stock as above). Low cards in foundations early free the tableau.</p>
