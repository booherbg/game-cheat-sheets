# Klondike Solitaire Cheat Sheet

Klondike is the classic "solitaire" game—the one most people mean when they say "solitaire." One-player patience: build four foundations up by suit from Ace to King, and build the tableau down in alternating colors. Turn cards from the stock (usually in groups of three) to the waste; only the top card of the waste is playable. Win by moving all 52 cards to the foundations.

## Setup
- Deck: standard 52 cards
- Players: 1
- **Tableau:** 7 columns. Column 1 has 1 card, column 2 has 2, … column 7 has 7. Only the top card of each column is face-up; the rest are face-down.
- **Foundations:** 4 empty piles (built up by suit, A→K).
- **Stock:** Remaining 24 cards, face-down.
- **Waste:** Face-up pile(s) for cards turned from the stock.

## Game Flow

### Tableau
- Build **down** in **alternating colors** (e.g. black 5 on red 6, red Q on black K).
- You may move a **single card** or a **complete sequence** of face-up cards as a unit.
- Only a **King** (or a sequence headed by a King) may be placed in an **empty column**.
- When you move all face-up cards off a column, **turn the next card face-up**; it is now in play.

### Foundations
- Move **Aces** to the foundations as they become available.
- On each foundation, build **up by suit** in order: A, 2, 3, … K. Only the next higher card of the same suit may be added.
- Cards in the foundations are out of play.

### Stock and waste
- Turn cards from the **stock** onto the **waste**. Common rule: turn **three cards at a time**; only the **top card** of the waste may be played to the tableau or foundations.
- If the top card is played, the next card down becomes playable.
- When the stock is empty, **turn the waste pile over** (without shuffling) to form a new stock. Many rules allow **one or three redeals** (passes through the deck); some allow unlimited redeals.

### Winning
- You win when all four foundations are complete (Ace through King in each suit).

## Variants (notes)

- **Draw one:** Turn one card at a time from the stock instead of three. Easier; often no redeal or one redeal.
- **Draw three:** Standard; one or three redeals are common.
- **No redeal:** Stock may be run through only once. Harder.
- **Empty tableau:** Some allow any card (not only a King) in an empty column; this is a different, easier game.
- **Visible stock:** Some play with the stock face-up so you can see the next card(s) before turning.
- **Forty Thieves, Yukon, etc.:** Other patience games use different layouts and rules; see separate cheat sheets if added.
