# Spider Solitaire Cheat Sheet

Spider uses two decks (104 cards). Build descending sequences (K down to A) on the tableau; only **same-suit** complete sequences (K→A) may be removed. When you're stuck, deal a new row of 10 cards from the stock—but you **cannot deal** while any column is empty. Win by clearing all eight sequences.

*Standard rules; [Bicycle Cards](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/spider-solitaire) uses an alternate final deal (see Dealing from the stock).*

## Setup
- Deck: **two standard 52-card decks** (104 cards); jokers removed.
- Players: 1
- **Tableau:** 10 columns. **54 cards** are dealt: the first 4 columns get **6 cards** each, the next 6 columns get **5 cards** each. Only the **top card** of each column is face-up; the rest are face-down.
- **Stock:** Remaining **50 cards**, face-down.
- **Foundation:** Completed same-suit sequences (K down to A) are removed from the tableau and set aside; no separate foundation piles—you "discard" full sequences.

## Game Flow

### Building on the tableau
- Build **down** in **descending order** (e.g. 9 on 10, Q on K). **Suits may be mixed** when building—you can put any 8 on any 9.
- You may move a **single card** or a **complete sequence** of cards (in descending order, any suits) as a unit, as long as the move is valid (the bottom card of the moved group goes on a card one rank higher).
- Only a **King** (or a sequence headed by a King) may be placed in an **empty column**.
- When you move all face-up cards off a column, **turn the next card face-up**.

### Removing sequences
- When a column has a **complete descending sequence in one suit** from **King down to Ace**, that sequence is **removed** from the tableau (set aside). That frees the column (or the cards under it). You do not build "foundations" on the side—you simply remove the 13 cards from play.
- **Goal:** Remove all **eight** sequences (2 per suit in the standard game).

### Dealing from the stock
- You start with **50 cards** in the stock. When you have **no (or no more) moves**, you may deal **one new row** from the stock: one card face-up onto the **top** of each of the 10 columns. Each deal uses **10 cards** (one per column).
- **Rule:** You **cannot deal** if **any column is empty**. You must fill empty columns with cards or sequences before you are allowed to deal from the stock.
- **Standard rule:** There are **5 deals** of 10 cards each. All **50 cards** enter play, so the game is winnable. After 5 deals the stock is empty.
- **Alternate rule (e.g. Bicycle Cards):** Some rule sets say the **final deal** is only **4 cards**—placed on the first four columns—leaving **6 cards** in the stock that are never dealt. That variant can make the game unwinnable if key cards are among those 6; use the standard rule above if you want a fair, winnable game.

### Winning
- You win when all **eight** same-suit sequences (K→A) have been removed from the tableau.

## Difficulty variants

Rules above are for **4 suits** (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades). Same two decks for all; only what "suit" means when **removing** a sequence changes:

- **4 suits:** Suit = actual suit. (Standard—rules above.) Hardest.
- **2 suits:** Suit = **red** (hearts + diamonds) or **black** (spades + clubs). A removable sequence must be all red or all black. Intermediate.
- **1 suit:** Suit doesn't matter—any K→A run may be removed. Easiest.

## Strategy tips
- Empty columns are powerful—but you must fill them before dealing. Prefer moving sequences that free face-down cards.
- Try to expose and turn face-down cards early.
- Building long mixed sequences can block cards; when possible, keep same-suit runs together so they can be removed as a unit.
- Avoid dealing until you've made every useful move; the deal adds cards and can make the position harder.
