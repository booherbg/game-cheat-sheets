# Eight Off (Baker's Game) Cheat Sheet

Like Freecell but with **eight cells** (four start with a card) and a crucial rule change: on the tableau you build **down by same suit**, not alternating colors. One deck, all face-up. Build four foundations up by suit (A→K). About one in three deals is winnable.

*Baker's Game* is the same idea with **four cells** (all empty at start) and the same tableau as Freecell: 8 columns with 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6 cards. Build down by same suit; empty columns accept only Kings. The rules below are for **Eight Off** (8 cells, 4 pre-filled).

## Setup
- Deck: **one standard 52-card deck**
- Players: 1
- **Tableau:** **8 columns**, 6 cards each (48 cards), all face-up.
- **Foundations:** 4 empty piles (build up by suit, A→K).
- **Cells:** **8 slots**, each holds one card. **4 cells start with a card** (from the deck); 4 start empty.

## Game Flow

### Foundations
- Move **Aces** to the foundations as they become available.
- Build **up by suit** in order: A, 2, 3, … K. Only the next higher card of the same suit may be added.
- **Goal:** Get all 52 cards onto the four foundations.

### Tableau
- Build **down by same suit** (e.g. 6♣ on 7♣, Q♥ on K♥). Only the **top card** of a column (or the top of a valid same-suit sequence) may be moved. You may move a **single card** or a **sequence** that forms a valid descending same-suit run.
- **Empty column:** Only a **King** (or a sequence headed by a King) may be placed in an empty tableau column.

### Cells
- Each cell holds **one card**. Use them to temporarily hold a card. Four cells are filled at the start; any card may be moved into an empty cell from the top of a column or from another cell.
- Cards in cells may be moved to a foundation or onto a valid tableau pile.

### Moving sequences
- You can move a **sequence** as a block only if you have enough **empty cells and empty columns** to unpack it one card at a time (same idea as Freecell). With 8 cells you can move longer sequences than in Freecell when many cells are free.

### Winning
- You win when all four foundations are complete (Ace through King in each suit).

## Strategy tips
- Move Aces and low cards to the foundations early.
- Use cells to unblock columns; keep some cells free so you can move sequences.
- Same-suit sequences are easier to build and move than in Freecell; try to keep runs in one suit when you can.
- Empty columns accept only Kings—clear a column when it helps, but remember you can’t fill it with any card.
