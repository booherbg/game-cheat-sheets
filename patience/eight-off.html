<h1>Eight Off (Baker&#39;s Game) Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Like Freecell but with <strong>eight cells</strong> (four start with a card) and a crucial rule change: on the tableau you build <strong>down by same suit</strong>, not alternating colors. One deck, all face-up. Build four foundations up by suit (A→K). About one in three deals is winnable.</p>
<p><em>Baker&#39;s Game</em> is the same idea with <strong>four cells</strong> (all empty at start) and the same tableau as Freecell: 8 columns with 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6 cards. Build down by same suit; empty columns accept only Kings. The rules below are for <strong>Eight Off</strong> (8 cells, 4 pre-filled).</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: <strong>one standard 52-card deck</strong></li>
<li>Players: 1</li>
<li><strong>Tableau:</strong> <strong>8 columns</strong>, 6 cards each (48 cards), all face-up.</li>
<li><strong>Foundations:</strong> 4 empty piles (build up by suit, A→K).</li>
<li><strong>Cells:</strong> <strong>8 slots</strong>, each holds one card. <strong>4 cells start with a card</strong> (from the deck); 4 start empty.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>Foundations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Move <strong>Aces</strong> to the foundations as they become available.</li>
<li>Build <strong>up by suit</strong> in order: A, 2, 3, … K. Only the next higher card of the same suit may be added.</li>
<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Get all 52 cards onto the four foundations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tableau</h3>
<ul>
<li>Build <strong>down by same suit</strong> (e.g. 6♣ on 7♣, Q♥ on K♥). Only the <strong>top card</strong> of a column (or the top of a valid same-suit sequence) may be moved. You may move a <strong>single card</strong> or a <strong>sequence</strong> that forms a valid descending same-suit run.</li>
<li><strong>Empty column:</strong> Only a <strong>King</strong> (or a sequence headed by a King) may be placed in an empty tableau column.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cells</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each cell holds <strong>one card</strong>. Use them to temporarily hold a card. Four cells are filled at the start; any card may be moved into an empty cell from the top of a column or from another cell.</li>
<li>Cards in cells may be moved to a foundation or onto a valid tableau pile.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Moving sequences</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can move a <strong>sequence</strong> as a block only if you have enough <strong>empty cells and empty columns</strong> to unpack it one card at a time (same idea as Freecell). With 8 cells you can move longer sequences than in Freecell when many cells are free.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winning</h3>
<ul>
<li>You win when all four foundations are complete (Ace through King in each suit).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Strategy tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Move Aces and low cards to the foundations early.</li>
<li>Use cells to unblock columns; keep some cells free so you can move sequences.</li>
<li>Same-suit sequences are easier to build and move than in Freecell; try to keep runs in one suit when you can.</li>
<li>Empty columns accept only Kings—clear a column when it helps, but remember you can’t fill it with any card.</li>
</ul>
