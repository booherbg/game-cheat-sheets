# Freecell Cheat Sheet

One deck (52 cards), all face-up. Build four foundations up by suit (A→K). Use four **free cells** to hold single cards and eight **tableau** columns built down in alternating colors. Unlike Klondike there is no stock—every card is visible from the start. Almost every deal is winnable.

## Setup
- Deck: **one standard 52-card deck**
- Players: 1
- **Tableau:** **8 columns**, all cards face-up. Columns 1–4 have **7 cards** each; columns 5–8 have **6 cards** each.
- **Foundations:** 4 empty piles (build up by suit, A→K).
- **Free cells:** 4 empty slots; each may hold **one card** at a time.

## Game Flow

### Foundations
- Move **Aces** to the foundations as they become available.
- Build **up by suit** in order: A, 2, 3, … K. Only the next higher card of the same suit may be added.
- **Goal:** Get all 52 cards onto the four foundations.

### Tableau
- Build **down** in **alternating colors** (e.g. black 5 on red 6, red Q on black K).
- Only the **top card** of a column (or the top card of a valid sequence) may be moved. You may move a **single card** or a **sequence** of cards that form a valid descending alternating-color run.
- **Empty column:** Any single card or valid sequence may be placed in an empty tableau column.

### Free cells
- Each free cell holds **one card**. Use them to temporarily park a card so you can reach the card below it or build a different sequence.
- Any card may be placed in an empty free cell. Only the top card of a column (or the leading card of a sequence you’re moving) may be moved into a free cell.

### Moving sequences
- You can move a **sequence** of cards as a block only if you have enough **empty free cells and empty columns** to unpack them one card at a time (e.g. move one card to a free cell, then the next onto the destination, etc.). With **4 empty free cells**, you can move a sequence of up to **5** cards. Empty tableau columns also increase how long a sequence you can move.

### Winning
- You win when all four foundations are complete (Ace through King in each suit).

## Strategy tips
- Move Aces and low cards to the foundations early to free space.
- Use free cells to unblock columns; avoid filling all four if you don’t need to.
- Empty columns are very powerful—they let you move longer sequences; try to clear one when you can.
- Plan a few moves ahead; since everything is visible, you can look for sequences that will build toward the foundations.
