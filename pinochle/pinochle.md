# Pinochle Cheat Sheet

Trick-taking partnership game (4 players, 2 teams) with a **meld** phase before tricks. Use a 48-card deck (two copies of 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in each suit). Bid for the right to name trump; then everyone melds for points; then 12 tricks are played. Count meld points plus trick points. First team to the target (often 250 or 500) wins.

## Setup
- Deck: **48 cards** — two copies each of 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in all four suits
- Players: 4 (partners sit across; teammates work together)
- Target score: **250** (or 500 for a longer game); agree before play
- Deal: 12 cards each, usually 3 or 4 at a time

## Game Flow

### 1. Deal
- Dealer gives **12 cards** to each player (all 48 cards).
- Optionally, the next card is turned for a proposed trump (or bidding is open).

### 2. Bidding
- Left of dealer bids first; bidding goes clockwise.
- Each player may **bid** (higher than the current bid) or **pass**. Once you pass, you're out for that round.
- Minimum bid is often **250** (or 300 in some house rules). Bids increase in steps (e.g. 250, 260, 270 … or 10-point steps).
- **Highest bidder** wins the bid and **names trump**. That player's team is the "declaring" team and must score at least their bid (meld + trick points) or they **lose** the bid amount (and the other team keeps their score).
- If everyone passes without a bid, the hand may be redealt or the dealer may be forced to bid (house rule).

### 3. Melding
- **Before** trick play, all four players lay down their **melds** and count points. Only valid combinations count (see Meld table below).
- The **same card** can be used in more than one meld (e.g. a Queen in a marriage and in Queens Around).
- Only the **declaring team** adds meld to their score if they make their bid; if they don't make the bid, their meld doesn't count. The **other team** always adds their meld.
- Meld is scored once per hand; then cards are picked up and tricks are played.

### 4. Trick play
- **Declarer** (or the player to declarer's left, by house rule) leads first.
- **12 tricks** are played. Winner of each trick leads to the next.
- **Follow suit** if you can. If you can't follow suit, you may **trump** or discard. In some rules you must trump if you have trump when you can't follow.
- **Winning a trick:** Highest card of the **led suit** wins, unless a **trump** is played—then the highest trump wins. When two identical cards are played, the **first** one played wins.
- **Card rank** (high to low): **A, 10, K, Q, J, 9** (note: 10 is above King).

### 5. Counting trick points
- After all 12 tricks, each team counts the **point value** of the cards in the tricks they won:
  - **Ace** = 11 · **10** = 10 · **King** = 4 · **Queen** = 3 · **Jack** = 2 · **9** = 0
- **Last trick** bonus: **10 points** to the team that won the last trick.
- Total trick points per hand = **250** (240 in cards + 10 last trick). Count your team's total and add to your score (along with meld, if applicable).

### 6. Making the bid
- **Declaring team:** If **meld + trick points ≥ bid**, they add **meld + trick points** to their score. If **meld + trick points < bid**, they **subtract** the **bid amount** from their score (meld does not count for them), and the other team adds their meld + trick points as usual.
- **Other team:** Always adds their meld + trick points.

### 7. Game end
- First team to reach the **target score** (e.g. 250 or 500) wins. Some play that you must win on a hand where your team made a bid.

## Melds (examples)

| Meld | Description | Points |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Marriage** | K + Q of same suit (non-trump) | 20 |
| **Royal marriage** | K + Q of **trump** | 40 |
| **Run** | A, 10, K, Q, J of **trump** (all five) | 150 |
| **Dix** | 9 of trump | 10 |
| **Pinochle** | J♦ + Q♠ (one of each) | 40 |
| **Aces Around** | One A in each suit | 100 |
| **Kings Around** | One K in each suit | 80 |
| **Queens Around** | One Q in each suit | 60 |
| **Jacks Around** | One J in each suit | 40 |

**Double** versions (two of each card in the combination) score much higher (e.g. Double Run = 1500, Double Aces Around = 1000). Count each meld that is present; the same card can be used in multiple melds.

## Strategy tips
- Bid only when you have strong meld and/or trump; if you don't make the bid, you lose the bid amount.
- Save high cards (A, 10) to win tricks that have high count; dump low cards on tricks your side will lose.
- Communicate with your partner through legal plays (no table talk)—leading a suit can signal strength or ask for a trump.
- Trump your opponents' winners when you can't follow and have trump to spare.
- Last trick is worth 10; sometimes worth fighting for if the count is close.
