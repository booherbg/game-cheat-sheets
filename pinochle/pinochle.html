<h1>Pinochle Cheat Sheet</h1>
<p>Trick-taking partnership game (4 players, 2 teams) with a <strong>meld</strong> phase before tricks. Use a 48-card deck (two copies of 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in each suit). Bid for the right to name trump; then everyone melds for points; then 12 tricks are played. Count meld points plus trick points. First team to the target (often 250 or 500) wins.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deck: <strong>48 cards</strong> — two copies each of 9, 10, J, Q, K, A in all four suits</li>
<li>Players: 4 (partners sit across; teammates work together)</li>
<li>Target score: <strong>250</strong> (or 500 for a longer game); agree before play</li>
<li>Deal: 12 cards each, usually 3 or 4 at a time</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<h3>1. Deal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dealer gives <strong>12 cards</strong> to each player (all 48 cards).</li>
<li>Optionally, the next card is turned for a proposed trump (or bidding is open).</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Bidding</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left of dealer bids first; bidding goes clockwise.</li>
<li>Each player may <strong>bid</strong> (higher than the current bid) or <strong>pass</strong>. Once you pass, you&#39;re out for that round.</li>
<li>Minimum bid is often <strong>250</strong> (or 300 in some house rules). Bids increase in steps (e.g. 250, 260, 270 … or 10-point steps).</li>
<li><strong>Highest bidder</strong> wins the bid and <strong>names trump</strong>. That player&#39;s team is the &quot;declaring&quot; team and must score at least their bid (meld + trick points) or they <strong>lose</strong> the bid amount (and the other team keeps their score).</li>
<li>If everyone passes without a bid, the hand may be redealt or the dealer may be forced to bid (house rule).</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Melding</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong> trick play, all four players lay down their <strong>melds</strong> and count points. Only valid combinations count (see Meld table below).</li>
<li>The <strong>same card</strong> can be used in more than one meld (e.g. a Queen in a marriage and in Queens Around).</li>
<li>Only the <strong>declaring team</strong> adds meld to their score if they make their bid; if they don&#39;t make the bid, their meld doesn&#39;t count. The <strong>other team</strong> always adds their meld.</li>
<li>Meld is scored once per hand; then cards are picked up and tricks are played.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Trick play</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarer</strong> (or the player to declarer&#39;s left, by house rule) leads first.</li>
<li><strong>12 tricks</strong> are played. Winner of each trick leads to the next.</li>
<li><strong>Follow suit</strong> if you can. If you can&#39;t follow suit, you may <strong>trump</strong> or discard. In some rules you must trump if you have trump when you can&#39;t follow.</li>
<li><strong>Winning a trick:</strong> Highest card of the <strong>led suit</strong> wins, unless a <strong>trump</strong> is played—then the highest trump wins. When two identical cards are played, the <strong>first</strong> one played wins.</li>
<li><strong>Card rank</strong> (high to low): <strong>A, 10, K, Q, J, 9</strong> (note: 10 is above King).</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Counting trick points</h3>
<ul>
<li>After all 12 tricks, each team counts the <strong>point value</strong> of the cards in the tricks they won:<ul>
<li><strong>Ace</strong> = 11 · <strong>10</strong> = 10 · <strong>King</strong> = 4 · <strong>Queen</strong> = 3 · <strong>Jack</strong> = 2 · <strong>9</strong> = 0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Last trick</strong> bonus: <strong>10 points</strong> to the team that won the last trick.</li>
<li>Total trick points per hand = <strong>250</strong> (240 in cards + 10 last trick). Count your team&#39;s total and add to your score (along with meld, if applicable).</li>
</ul>
<h3>6. Making the bid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declaring team:</strong> If <strong>meld + trick points ≥ bid</strong>, they add <strong>meld + trick points</strong> to their score. If <strong>meld + trick points &lt; bid</strong>, they <strong>subtract</strong> the <strong>bid amount</strong> from their score (meld does not count for them), and the other team adds their meld + trick points as usual.</li>
<li><strong>Other team:</strong> Always adds their meld + trick points.</li>
</ul>
<h3>7. Game end</h3>
<ul>
<li>First team to reach the <strong>target score</strong> (e.g. 250 or 500) wins. Some play that you must win on a hand where your team made a bid.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Double</strong> versions (two of each card in the combination) score much higher (e.g. Double Run = 1500, Double Aces Around = 1000). Count each meld that is present; the same card can be used in multiple melds.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Strategy tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bid only when you have strong meld and/or trump; if you don&#39;t make the bid, you lose the bid amount.</li>
<li>Save high cards (A, 10) to win tricks that have high count; dump low cards on tricks your side will lose.</li>
<li>Communicate with your partner through legal plays (no table talk)—leading a suit can signal strength or ask for a trump.</li>
<li>Trump your opponents&#39; winners when you can&#39;t follow and have trump to spare.</li>
<li>Last trick is worth 10; sometimes worth fighting for if the count is close.</li>
</ul>
